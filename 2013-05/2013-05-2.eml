I don't think we singled it out.
But the list of drafts on the announcement is indeed focused on drafts =
that are solidly INT area.

One thing that I learned in 6lowpan (and then in core) is that it is =
much harder to do "system standard" type work.  Do we have the energy to =
get the contributions and reviews?  We didn't in those two WGs.

Since this is my first message to this new list, I would like to add =
that I plan to wait a couple more days so that people have noticed the =
list and subscribed before beginning the charter discussion in earnest.

Gr=FC=DFe, Carsten
