Document: draft-ietf-6lo-blemesh-08
Reviewer: Pete Resnick
Review Date: 2020-12-04
IETF LC End Date: 2020-10-21
IESG Telechat date: Not scheduled for a telechat

Summary: Looks good to me, with two items that seemed confusing enough that
they should be addressed.

Note that this review is being done well after the close of the Last Call.
Since this is not yet scheduled for a telechat, the AD asked that I go ahead
and complete the review anyway.

Major issues: None

Minor issues:

3.3.2, #4:

   Implementations of this specification MAY support
   the features described in sections 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 6775, as
   updated by RFC 8505, unless some alternative ("substitute") from some
   other specification is supported by the implementation.

This bit confused me. I think it was the "unless". Do you mean it MAY support
the 6775/8505 features, or MAY support some substitute, or MAY support neither,
or do you mean that it MUST support either the 6775/8505 features or MUST
support some substitute? I think you want to rewrite this to make it clear
which one you mean.

3.3.3, last two paragraphs:

   When a 6LN transmits a packet, with a non-link-local source address
   that the 6LN has registered with EARO in the next-hop router for the
   indicated prefix, the source address MUST be fully elided if it is
   the latest address that the 6LN has registered for the indicated
   prefix (SAC=1, SAM=11).  If the source non-link-local address is not
   the latest registered by the 6LN, then the 64 bits of the IID SHALL
   be fully carried in-line (SAC=1, SAM=01) or if the first 48 bits of
   the IID match with the latest address registered by the 6LN, then the
   last 16 bits of the IID SHALL be carried in-line (SAC=1, SAM=10).

   When a router transmits a packet to a neighboring 6LN, with a non-
   link-local destination address, the router MUST fully elide the
   destination IPv6 address if the destination address is the latest
   registered by the 6LN with EARO for the indicated context (DAC=1,
   DAM=11).  If the destination address is a non-link-local address and
   not the latest registered, then the 6LN MUST either include the IID
   part fully in-line (DAM=01) or, if the first 48 bits of the IID match
   to the latest registered address, then elide those 48 bits (DAM=10).

Both of these were a bit confusing to me. I think you want to reverse the order
of the last two choices. Say something like (for the first paragraph), "If the
source non-link-local address is not the latest registered by the 6LN and the
first 48 bits match..., then the last 16 bits SHALL be carried in-line.
Otherwise, if first 48 bits do not match, then the 64 bits shall be carried
inline." Similarly for the second. As it is, it takes a while to figure out
what it means.

Nits/editorial comments: Do fix the reference nits noted by the nits tool; they
appear to be simple typos.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : IPv6 Mesh over BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy using IPSP
        Authors         : Carles Gomez
                          Seyed Mahdi Darroudi
                          Teemu Savolainen

	Pages           : 16
	Date            : 2020-12-07

Abstract:
   RFC 7668 describes the adaptation of 6LoWPAN techniques to enable
   IPv6 over Bluetooth low energy networks that follow the star
   topology.  However, recent Bluetooth specifications allow the
   formation of extended topologies as well.  This document specifies
   mechanisms that are needed to enable IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth Low
   Energy links established by using the Bluetooth Internet Protocol
   Support Profile.  This document does not specify the routing protocol
   to be used in an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links.

Hi Dominique,

Sorry for the late reply, and thanks a lot for your thorough review of the
draft!

We just submitted -09, which aims at addressing the last round of review
comments, including yours:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-blemesh-09

Yes! We added a reference to RFC 8174.

We added one sentence to explicitly indicate the consequences of not
registering the address:

NEW:
   However, the consequences of not registering the address (including non-
   reachability of the 6LN, and absence of DAD) need to be carefully
   considered.

Yes, we added that reference. We also changed the "will decrease" to "may
decrease", and briefly explained the reason why:

NEW:
   If the 6LN registers multiple addresses that are not based on the
   Bluetooth device address using the same compression context, the
   header compression efficiency may decrease, since only the last
   registered address can be fully elided (see Section 3.2.4 of RFC
   7668).

In RFC 7668, which focuses on a star topology where links are formed via
BLE Link Layer connections, a 6LBR that receives a packet from a 6LN knows
that the packet comes from *that* 6LN (since the packet arrives at the
6LBR via a specific BLE Link Layer connection), but the 6LBR does not
necessarily know which is the current non-link-local address of the 6LN.
(The prefix of that address may always be the same, but perhaps the IID
may change somewhat frequently, e.g. for privacy reasons, and the IID may
be independent of the BLE Link Layer connection identifier.) In order to
allow the 6LBR know which is the current non-link-local address, RFC 7668
uses ARO, so that the last registered non-link-local address is the
current one. If the 6LN uses the last registered address, then the IPv6
source address can be (actually is) fully elided, since the 6LBR will be
able to decompress that address (i.e. the 6LBR knows the current
non-link-local address of the 6LN). For previously used 6LN addresses
(which are not the current/last one, but have the same prefix), only the
prefix can be elided.

So, back to your question “why the address last registered with the ARO
gets a better compression than other addresses that share the same
prefix?”, the answer is that header compression exploits not only the 6282
context, but also the underlying star network topology, the fact that
links in that topology are based on connections, and the fact that ARO
provides additional information about which is the current 6LN
non-link-local address in use.

Yes, that is our assumption. We have clarified that in -09:

NEW:
   Note that 6CO is not needed for context-based
   compression when context is pre-provisioned or provided by out-of-
   band means.

It is not specific to the case where a single prefix is used in the
network. The updated text (above) does not mention the single prefix case.

I must admit that I don't actually remember why a MUST was used when we
wrote RFC 7668. Perhaps constraining the space of allowed options was
considered valuable for the sake of simplicity.

Perhaps an update might make sense. On the other hand, a set of devices
where there are no 6LRs (i.e., only 6LNs and a 6LBR) implementing
draft-ietf-6lo-blemesh may form a star-topology network supporting
pre-provisioned context or context provided by out-of-band means.

We tried to improve clarity of the text by adding text between
parentheses, as follows.

NEW:
   These cases comprise
   link-local interactions, non-link-local packet transmissions
   originated by a 6LN (i.e. the first hop from a 6LN), and non-link-
   local packets intended for a 6LN that are originated or forwarded by
   a neighbor of that 6LN (i.e. the last hop toward a 6LN).

We used a form inspired by the latter in -09:

    "... the hosts that participate in an IPv6 mesh over BLE"

We aimed to clarify the meaning of that text as follows.

NEW:
   is initialized, that is, the 6LBR uses both the IPSP Node and IPSP Router
   roles at all times.  See an example in Appendix B.

- 3.3.2: "See an example in the Appendix" -->

Done.

It is now referenced from the last paragraph of Section 2.

Once again, thanks a lot for your detailed and insightful comments!

Agreed. We modified the text as follows:

NEW:
   Implementations of this specification MUST either
   support the features described in sections 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 6775,
   as updated by RFC 8505, or some alternative ("substitute") mechanism.

> 3.3.3, last two paragraphs:
>
>    When a 6LN transmits a packet, with a non-link-local source address
>    that the 6LN has registered with EARO in the next-hop router for the
>    indicated prefix, the source address MUST be fully elided if it is
>    the latest address that the 6LN has registered for the indicated
>    prefix (SAC=1, SAM=11).  If the source non-link-local address is not
>    the latest registered by the 6LN, then the 64 bits of the IID SHALL
>    be fully carried in-line (SAC=1, SAM=01) or if the first 48 bits of
>    the IID match with the latest address registered by the 6LN, then the
>    last 16 bits of the IID SHALL be carried in-line (SAC=1, SAM=10).
>
>    When a router transmits a packet to a neighboring 6LN, with a non-
>    link-local destination address, the router MUST fully elide the
>    destination IPv6 address if the destination address is the latest
>    registered by the 6LN with EARO for the indicated context (DAC=1,
>    DAM=11).  If the destination address is a non-link-local address and
>    not the latest registered, then the 6LN MUST either include the IID
>    part fully in-line (DAM=01) or, if the first 48 bits of the IID match
>    to the latest registered address, then elide those 48 bits (DAM=10).
>

We modified the two paragraphs as per your suggestion.

Done!
