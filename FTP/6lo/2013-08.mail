I just merged Ulrich's rendition of the charter changes from the BOF:

	=
https://github.com/6lo/charter/commit/81e3f93baafc2b3da53657dc26828d00424c=
3bd4

and slightly updated it editorially (pointing to "6LoWPAN technologies" =
as we said at the BOF):

	=
https://github.com/6lo/charter/commit/44ca4c9fccc89bc1a0f37af54c4f04948120=
cc9e

As usual, please see the full current version at

	https://github.com/6lo/charter

Are we missing any charter changes that were agreed during the BOF?

Gr=FC=DFe, Carsten

All,
      I have kicked off the chartering for the 6lo WG.  For those 
interested, you can follow the progress via the datatracker:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-6lo/

The proposed charter is based on the latest version discussed on the 
mailing list and during the 6lo BoF in Berlin. 
Comments/suggestions/questions welcome.

Regards,
Brian

Hi,=0A=0AI haven't had a chance to do a thorough read though, however I hav=
en't been able to find where the following scenarios is dealt with.=A0=0A=
=0AIn a pure energy efficient scenario, say there are two NEAR routers on t=
he link (NEAR1, NEAR2). An EAH host (EAH1) at bootstrap chooses NEAR1, regi=
sters its addresses and uses NEAR1 as its egress router for off-link traffi=
c. For the return traffic (i.e, off-link traffic coming onto the energy eff=
icient segment), what occurs if the upstream network chooses to use NEAR2 t=
o try to forward traffic to EAH1, as the upstream network considers NEAR2 r=
ather than NEAR1 to be closer to EAH1 e.g, because of a smaller IGP metric,=
 or the traffic source link is directly attached to NEAR2?=0A=0AIn my under=
standing, NEAR2 wouldn't have knowledge of EAH1, because EAH1 has only been=
 registered with NEAR1. So it would seem that currently the only choice is =
for NEAR2 to drop those packets.=0A=0AFurther to this two or more NEAR scen=
ario, even if the upstream network always considers NEAR1 to be the closer =
to the EAHs, if the NEARs are protected by a redundancy protocol such as VR=
RP, when VRRP switches from using NEAR1 to NEAR2, how does NEAR2 acquire ad=
dress registration information? Would it be considered a EAH bootstrap even=
t, so that all of the EAHs have to go through selection and then registrati=
on of a NEAR? While I think that would work, it would seem to be defeating =
the purpose of having a redundancy protocol like VRRP which tries to make s=
witching over between routers nearly if not ideally transparent to downstre=
am hosts.=0A=0ARegards,=0AMark.=0A

Hello Mark:

There is a need for a protocol between the 6LBRs/NEAR routers to exchange t=
heir state.
This could be achieved by an extension on ND for proxy operations as descri=
bed in dratf-thubert-6lowpan-backbone-router, a similar extension to a rout=
ing protocol running on the backbone or a richer extension to IPv6 NDP allo=
wing some degree of pub/sub as well.

We are in the process of writing a personal submission describing the latte=
r, I hope we can publish soon.

Cheers,=20

Pascal

Hi,

I haven't had a chance to do a thorough read though, however I haven't been=
 able to find where the following scenarios is dealt with.=A0

In a pure energy efficient scenario, say there are two NEAR routers on the =
link (NEAR1, NEAR2). An EAH host (EAH1) at bootstrap chooses NEAR1, registe=
rs its addresses and uses NEAR1 as its egress router for off-link traffic. =
For the return traffic (i.e, off-link traffic coming onto the energy effici=
ent segment), what occurs if the upstream network chooses to use NEAR2 to t=
ry to forward traffic to EAH1, as the upstream network considers NEAR2 rath=
er than NEAR1 to be closer to EAH1 e.g, because of a smaller IGP metric, or=
 the traffic source link is directly attached to NEAR2?

In my understanding, NEAR2 wouldn't have knowledge of EAH1, because EAH1 ha=
s only been registered with NEAR1. So it would seem that currently the only=
 choice is for NEAR2 to drop those packets.

Further to this two or more NEAR scenario, even if the upstream network alw=
ays considers NEAR1 to be the closer to the EAHs, if the NEARs are protecte=
d by a redundancy protocol such as VRRP, when VRRP switches from using NEAR=
1 to NEAR2, how does NEAR2 acquire address registration information? Would =
it be considered a EAH bootstrap event, so that all of the EAHs have to go =
through selection and then registration of a NEAR? While I think that would=
 work, it would seem to be defeating the purpose of having a redundancy pro=
tocol like VRRP which tries to make switching over between routers nearly i=
f not ideally transparent to downstream hosts.

Regards,
Mark.

All,
      I would be interested in feedback on Adrian's concern about the 
reference to an I-D in the charter.

      You can ignore his comment about "IPv6-over-foo", we have already 
straightened that out with him.

Adrian Farrel has entered the following ballot position for
charter-ietf-6lo-00-00: Block

When responding, please keep the subject line intact and reply to all
email addresses included in the To and CC lines. (Feel free to cut this
introductory paragraph, however.)



The document, along with other ballot positions, can be found here:
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-6lo/



----------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOCK:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

My main concern is that it is not appropriate for a charter to give, as a
key
reference scoping its work, a pointer to an Internet-Draft.  This is not
only
the case because I-Ds contain boiler-plate saying that it is
inappropriate to
cite them, but also because the definitions in the referenced I-D are
currently
under debate and the subject of an IESG Discuss.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

My other concerns are considerably addressed by the last two paragraphs,
but
would, I think benefit from some word-smithing...




"IPv6-over-foo specifications" is particularly loose.  TCP is an
IP-over-foo
technology.  Can the proposed working group work on it?  What about
enhancements
to TCP to take account of the constrained nature of the under-lying
network?

It is possible that this work is intended to be scoped to foo being one
of the
technologies covered by RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775, but that is not
clear.

---

   Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression,
   specific to constrained node networks

Maybe "common infrastructure" has a specific meaning in the Internet
Area, but
some people might assume that a routing protocol was a common
infrastructure :-)
I would, for example, consider mesh-under routing protocols to be suspect
within
this scope, but would find it hard to scope them out witthese words.

If you have other things in mind, it might be good to list them. If
header
compression is the only one, then perhaps change the to talk only about
that.

Maybe also be careful to narrow down which headers you mean.

---

Nit...

s/MIBs/MIB modules/

And maybe you want to say for what purpose. Many folk feel they are
obliged to write
MIB modules these days, but don't really know why they are doing it.

During the BOF, one comment was that we should clarify what a =
constrained node network is.

The simplest way to accommodate that request seemed to be to add a =
pointer to the document that explains this term.
At the time it wasn't obvious that there still was a need for discussion =
for that document.

The new text from Aug 5 was:

# Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained =
networks,=20
# according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology, are in =
scope.

I don't think we actually need the clarification "according..."; it is =
pretty clear what a constrained node network is.

If people do think we need a clarification, we don't need the pointer to =
a work-in-progress I-D; we can just copy/paste the two paragraphs.

Gr=FC=DFe, Carsten

Hi,

why not simply copy the _definitions_ (not the explanations) of
Constrained Node, Constrained Network and Constrained Node Network
out of the I-D into the charter?

/js

PS: The main purpose of the MIB modules is to define the instrumentation
    required for monitoring and in particular troubleshooting purposes.

Are the wired part of the 6LBRs always located on the same link?
I'm asking because it seems like this is an important assumption.
I read 6lowpan-backbone-router-03.
Please number the figure in section 3. I'll call it "Figure Plan Network"

I don't like the term backbone, and backbone router.
What I see are three areas of a DAG connected by a heterogeneous layer-2.
The "BBR" are just RPL routers.  I don't know why a new protocol is
necessary for the mesh-over case.=20

Perhaps the MESH-under case has some requirements, but I'd rather just
pretend that it's four links (an ethernet link, and three mesh-under links)
connected together to form a single mesh-over network.

It seems to me that you are inventing a protocol to solve the MESH-under
problem, but that we already have such a protocol.

J=FCrgen,

I think that would work.

Regarding Adrian's comment about "Common infrastructure specifications",
would it help to add more qualification like "Common internet layer and
management infrastructure specifications"?

Best regards

That sounds almost as non-deterministic as the text Adrian is 
complaining about.  I suggest taking his suggestion to heart and list 
the types of infrastructure you currently have in mind.  The charter can 
be updated to include other types of services if/when they are identified.

                  &gt; "IPv6-over-foo specifications" is particularly
                  loose. &nbsp;TCP is an<br>
                  &gt; IP-over-foo<br>

                  &gt;<br>
                  &gt; It is possible that this work is intended to be

                  &gt; of the<br>
                  &gt; technologies covered by RFC4944, RFC6282,
                  RFC6775, but that is not<br>

                  &gt;<br>
                  &gt; Maybe "common infrastructure" has a specific
                  meaning in the Internet<br>
                  &gt; Area, but<br>
                  &gt; some people might assume that a routing protocol
                  was a common<br>
                  &gt; infrastructure :-)<br>
                  &gt; I would, for example, consider mesh-under routing
                  protocols to be suspect<br>
                  &gt; within<br>
                  &gt; this scope, but would find it hard to scope them

                  &gt;<br>
                  &gt; If you have other things in mind, it might be

                  &gt; header<br>
                  &gt; compression is the only one, then perhaps change

                  &gt;<br>
                  &gt; Maybe also be careful to narrow down which

I would suggest something like the following change:

"Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression,=20
specific to constrained node networks"

to:

"Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to more =

than one adaptation specification"

based on:

1) Changing "IPv6-over-foo specifications" to "adaptation=20
specifications"; Brian said IPv6-over-foo had been dealt with but didn't =

say how.
2) No need to mention constrained node networks as "adaptation=20
specification" already implies this.

Hi Carsten,

I like both the terms you mention so either would work for me. I have no =

problem at all with "adaptation layer"; I was simply reluctant to use=20
the word "layer" as that tends to have connotations wrt. OSI etc. I have =

often described 6lowpan as "layer 2.5", which clarifies where it sits=20
more or less but that's about it.

Robert

Good discussion.  Thanks.  Will one of you send text with concrete =

How about:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node networks,
as defined in section 2.1. and 2.2. of draft-ietf-lwig-terminology.

NEW:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node networks,
using the following definitions:
  -  Constrained Node:  A node where some of the characteristics that are
otherwise pretty much taken for granted for Internet nodes in 2013 are not
attainable, often due to cost constraints and/or physical constraints on
characteristics such as size, weight, and available power and energy.
  -  Constrained Network:  A network where some of the characteristics
pretty much taken for granted with link layers in common use in the
Internet by 2013, are not attainable.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D


Specifically, it is working on
  - IPv6-over-foo specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies (RFC4944,
RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in constrained
node networks;

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD
  - related MIBs;

NEW
  - related MIB modules;
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD
  - common infrastructure specification such as header compression specific
to constrained node networks;

NEW
  - specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to more
than one adaptation layer specification;
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  -  maintenance and informational documents required for the existing IETF
specifications in this space.


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained networks,
according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology, are in scope.

NEW
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained networks,
according to the above definitions of these terms, are in scope.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue to
work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network space
and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call.
Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out to
6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and INTAREA=
.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does not take on
larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work under discussion). The
working group will continue to reuse existing protocols and mechanisms
whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers being
worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of scope. 6Lo
will coordinate closely with the working groups in other areas that focus
on constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP), and
appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security areas including potential
future groups spawned from efforts such as COMAN and SOLACE.

        6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will
        continue to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the
        constrained node network space and will continue to be the focal
        point for IPv6 maintenance. For adaptation layer specifications
        that do not have implications on IPv6 architecture, 6man will be
        notified about 6Lo's working group last call. Specifications
        that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6 addresses in
        a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be closely
        coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out

        6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does
        not take on larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work

        existing protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and
        possible.<br>
        <br>
        Security and management work that is not specific to the link
        layers being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing
        is out of scope. 6Lo will coordinate closely with the working
        groups in other areas that focus on constrained node networks,
        such as today ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP), and appropriate groups
        in the IETF OPS and Security areas including potential future

those in which certain resources are severely limited, such as
bandwidth, computational power, storage, power, or energy.

Note: I don't think that we really care about, for example, size and
weight constraints, except to the extent that these limitations affect
the amount of things we care about (e.g., bandwidth, computational
power, storage, ...).  That is, I suggest that we talk about only the
things that affect us.  I further suggest that mention of such things
as cost, size, weight, and other things that affect us only indirectly,
is superfluous.

Hi,

please note that a 'constrained network' is not the same as a
'constrained node network' according to [1] and NEWEST is now moving
from 'constrained node networks' to 'constrained networks'.

The original charter text talked about constrained node networks and
if that was by intention, we should use a wording like this:

  6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node
  networks, i.e., networks whose characteristics are influenced by
  being composed of a significant portion of constrained nodes. A
  constrained node is a node where some of the characteristics that
  are otherwise pretty much taken for granted for Internet nodes in
  2013 are not attainable.

A couple more suggested tweaks:

1. For completeness we also include the definition of "Constrained node=20
network" from draft-ietf-lwig-terminology-05:

Constrained Node Network:  A network whose characteristics are=20
influenced by being composed of a significant portion of constrained node=
s.

2. Use the term "constrained node networks" as the target for the WG,=20
with the implication this refers to constrained nodes and constrained=20
networks as defined.

So here is the suggested complete OLD/NEW charter text, based on=20
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-6lo/ as written and=20
bracketed by <charter text></charter text>:

<charter text>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node=20
networks, as defined in section 2.1. and 2.2. of=20
draft-ietf-lwig-terminology. Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies (RFC4944,=20
RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in constrained =

node networks

2. Related MIBs

3. Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression,=20
specific to constrained node networks

NEW:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node=20
networks, using the following definitions:

   -  Constrained Node:  A node where some of the characteristics that=20
are otherwise pretty much taken for granted for Internet nodes in 2013=20
are not attainable, often due to cost constraints and/or physical=20
constraints on characteristics such as size, weight, and available power =

and energy.
   -  Constrained Network:  A network where some of the characteristics=20
pretty much taken for granted with link layers in common use in the=20
Internet by 2013, are not attainable.
   -  Constrained Node Network:  A network whose characteristics are=20
influenced by being composed of a significant portion of constrained node=
s.

Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN=20
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of=20
interest in constrained node networks

2. Related MIB modules

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to=20
more than one adaptation layer specification
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

4.  maintenance and informational documents required for the existing=20
IETF specifications in this space.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained=20
networks, according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology,=20
are in scope.

NEW:
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes networks, according to=20
the above definitions of these terms, are in scope.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue=20
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network=20
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For=20
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6=20
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call. =

Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6=20
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be=20
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out=20
to 6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and=20
INTAREA.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does not take=20
on larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work under discussion). =

The working group will continue to reuse existing protocols and=20
mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers=20
being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of=20
scope. 6Lo will coordinate closely with the working groups in other=20
areas that focus on constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG)=20
and CoRE (APP), and appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security=20
areas including potential future groups spawned from efforts such as=20
COMAN and SOLACE.

Argh, one tiny blip spotted (I wrote "constrained nodes networks"). Try=20

<charter text>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node=20
networks, as defined in section 2.1. and 2.2. of=20
draft-ietf-lwig-terminology. Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies (RFC4944,=20
RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in constrained =

node networks

2. Related MIBs

3. Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression,=20
specific to constrained node networks

NEW:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node=20
networks, using the following definitions:

   -  Constrained Node:  A node where some of the characteristics that=20
are otherwise pretty much taken for granted for Internet nodes in 2013=20
are not attainable, often due to cost constraints and/or physical=20
constraints on characteristics such as size, weight, and available power =

and energy.
   -  Constrained Network:  A network where some of the characteristics=20
pretty much taken for granted with link layers in common use in the=20
Internet by 2013, are not attainable.
   -  Constrained Node Network:  A network whose characteristics are=20
influenced by being composed of a significant portion of constrained node=
s.

Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN=20
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of=20
interest in constrained node networks

2. Related MIB modules

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to=20
more than one adaptation layer specification
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

4.  maintenance and informational documents required for the existing=20
IETF specifications in this space.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained=20
networks, according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology,=20
are in scope.

NEW:
Only specifications targeting constrained node networks, according to=20
the above definitions of these terms, are in scope.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue=20
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network=20
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For=20
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6=20
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call. =

Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6=20
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be=20
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out=20
to 6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and=20
INTAREA.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does not take=20
on larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work under discussion). =

The working group will continue to reuse existing protocols and=20
mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers=20
being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of=20
scope. 6Lo will coordinate closely with the working groups in other=20
areas that focus on constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG)=20
and CoRE (APP), and appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security=20
areas including potential future groups spawned from efforts such as=20
COMAN and SOLACE.

If the idea is to cover constrained networks as well as constrained
node networks, I would prefer to have this stated explicitely.

COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with Adrian that the draft shouldn't be main impetus for a
charter.  If it is, then I think we can't charter this until the lwig
terminology is actually approved and maybe even published.

In addition, I think the following could be tightened up:

6Lo will
coordinate closely with the working groups in other areas that focus on
constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP), and
appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security areas including potential
future
groups spawned from efforts such as COMAN and SOLACE.

Maybe:

6Lo will
coordinate closely with the working groups in other areas that focus on
constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP).

For #4, is there maintenance needed already or is that future proofing
the charter?  Also, what information documents are needed - are there
some already written?

a) It's just an example,  b) you don't actually need to list everything,
and c) COMAN and SOLACE might not happen.

Also, isn't it s2.3 in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology that defines
"Constrained Node Networks" not s2.1 and s2.2?

Hello Michael:

The BBR draft will be repositioned as a number of functions are migrated to=
 other drafts, including efficient ND.
What will be left in the BBr draft is probably the function by a RPL root (=
LBR) to proxy ND over the backbone so as to attract traffic for IPv6 addres=
ses that are located on the LLN.
So it is not just a root. The key piece is the mapping (redistribution?) of=
 RPL routes learnt from DAO into a Binding Table state in order to enable N=
D proxy operation.

>  Are the wired part of the 6LBRs always located on the same link?
Yes. This is why we call this link the backbone. It is expected to be a tra=
nsit link where traditional NDP operates. Backbone Router is the term used =
by ISA100.11a to refer to the routing entity that federates multiple LLNs a=
s a single subnet over a high speed backbone. I'm using that same term to e=
ase communication between ISA and IETF.


> It seems to me that you are inventing a protocol to solve the MESH-under =
problem, but that we already have such a protocol.
The backbone router does not operate mesh routing at all. It is really focu=
sed on ND proxy operation over a transit link we use as federating backbone=
 for a multilink subnet.

Cheers,=20

Are the wired part of the 6LBRs always located on the same link?
I'm asking because it seems like this is an important assumption.
I read 6lowpan-backbone-router-03.
Please number the figure in section 3. I'll call it "Figure Plan Network"

I don't like the term backbone, and backbone router.
What I see are three areas of a DAG connected by a heterogeneous layer-2.
The "BBR" are just RPL routers.  I don't know why a new protocol is necessa=
ry for the mesh-over case.=20

Perhaps the MESH-under case has some requirements, but I'd rather just pret=
end that it's four links (an ethernet link, and three mesh-under links) con=
nected together to form a single mesh-over network.

It seems to me that you are inventing a protocol to solve the MESH-under pr=
oblem, but that we already have such a protocol.

Would late binding on the definitions lack sufficient specificity (the =
following is based mostly on Robert's suggested modifications)?

<charter text>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node =
networks, as defined in section 2.1. and 2.2. of =
draft-ietf-lwig-terminology. Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies (RFC4944, =
RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in constrained =
node networks

2. Related MIBs

3. Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression, =
specific to constrained node networks

NEW:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node =
networks, as that term is defined by the LWIG working group.

Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN =
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of =
interest in constrained node networks

2. Related MIB modules

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to =
more than one adaptation layer specification
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=20
4.  maintenance and informational documents required for the existing =
IETF specifications in this space.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained =
networks, according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology, =
are in scope.

NEW:
Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in scope.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue =
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network =
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For =
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6 =
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call. =
Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6 =
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be =
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out =
to 6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and =
INTAREA.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does not take =
on larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work under discussion). =
The working group will continue to reuse existing protocols and =
mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers =
being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of =
scope. 6Lo will coordinate closely with the working groups in other =
areas that focus on constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG) =
and CoRE (APP), and appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security =
areas including potential future groups spawned from efforts such as =
COMAN and SOLACE.

Purists won't like that it seems to give LWIG power to redefine the =

6lo can always recharter if lwig takes its definitions off in a =

There is some potential maintenance to discuss.  The ETSI 6LoWPAN =
plugtest event revealed that the uncompressed mode in RFC 4944 (dispatch =
code 0x41) is not useful as intended and should be considered for =
deprecation.

OK, your suggested text looks fine with me.

We're having an parallel discussion about the definitions.

All,
      I would suggest incorporating Sean's suggested text with the 
changes being made to address Adrian's Block position.

Updated to incorporate Sean Turner's suggested changes.

<charter text>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node =
networks, as defined in section 2.1. and 2.2. of =
draft-ietf-lwig-terminology. Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies (RFC4944, =
RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in constrained =
node networks

2. Related MIBs

3. Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression, =
specific to constrained node networks

NEW:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node =
networks, as that term is defined by the LWIG working group.

Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN =
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of =
interest in constrained node networks

2. Related MIB modules

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to =
more than one adaptation layer specification
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

4.  maintenance and informational documents required for the existing =
IETF specifications in this space.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD:
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained =
networks, according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology, =
are in scope.

NEW:
Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in scope.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue =
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network =
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For =
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6 =
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call. =
Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6 =
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be =
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out =
to 6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and =
INTAREA.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does not take =
on larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work under discussion). =
The working group will continue to reuse existing protocols and =
mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers =
being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of =
scope. 6Lo will coordinate closely with the working groups in other =
areas that focus on constrained node networks, such as ROLL (RTG) and =
CoRE (APP).

It seems like the modification proposed by Sean is not surrounded by
OLD/NEW (in the last sentence). Shouldn't it be:

<charter text>
=============
OLD:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node networks,
as defined in section 2.1. and 2.2. of draft-ietf-lwig-terminology.
Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies (RFC4944,
RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in constrained
node networks

2. Related MIBs

3. Common infrastructure specifications, such as header compression,
specific to constrained node networks

NEW:
6Lo focuses on INT area work that is needed for constrained node networks,
as that term is defined by the LWIG working group.

Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies
(RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in
constrained node networks

2. Related MIB modules

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to more
than one adaptation layer specification
=============

4.  maintenance and informational documents required for the existing IETF
specifications in this space.

=============
OLD:
Only specifications targeting constrained nodes and constrained networks,
according to the definition in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology, are in scope.

NEW:
Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in scope.
=============

6Lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue to
work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network space
and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call.
Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out to
6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and INTAREA.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of INT area work. 6Lo does not take on
larger cross-layer efforts (such as the 6TSCH work under discussion). The
working group will continue to reuse existing protocols and mechanisms
whenever reasonable and possible.

=============
OLD:
Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers being
worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of scope. 6Lo
will coordinate closely with the working groups in other areas that focus
on constrained node networks, such as today ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP), and
appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security areas including potential
future groups spawned from efforts such as COMAN and SOLACE.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers being
worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of scope. 6Lo

All,
      this is what I am going to submit to the datatracker.  Can someone 
confirm that it captures all the proposed changes before I hit 'Submit'?

6Lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node 
networks, as the term is defined by the LWIG working group.

Specifically, it will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN 
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of 
interest in constrained node networks

2. Related MIB modules

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to 
more than one adaptation layer specification

4. Maintenance and informational documents required for the existing 
IETF specifications in this space.

Only specifications targeting constrained nodes are in scope. 6Lo will 
work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue to work on 
IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network space and 
will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance. For adaptation 
layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6 architecture, 
6man will be notified about 6Lo's working group last call. 
Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6 
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options) will be 
closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be fanned out 
to 6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6Lo will also coordinate with LWIG and 
INTAREA.

6Lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area work. 6Lo does not 
take on larger cross-layer efforts. The working group will continue to 
reuse existing protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers 
being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of 
scope. 6Lo will coordinate closely with the working groups in other 
areas that focus on constrained node networks, such as ROLL (RTG) and 
CoRE (APP).

Thanks, Brian. I noticed one difference. The text I sent out in NEW said:

        Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in
scope.

Your text says:

         Only specifications targeting constrained nodes are in scope.

(without "networks"). Is this intentional? Or maybe I have just missed a
previous conclusion on this sentence.

Hi Adrian,
      I have CC:'ed the 6lo mailing list to keep them in the loop...

The key work is extending the 6LoWPAN RFCs to other link layers.  The 
LWIG definition offers a baseline for where those RFCs may be 
applicable.  One option thrown around on the mailing list was to add the 
definitions to the charter rather than rely on the LWIG document (which 
is no longer mentioned in the charter).

The line is quite clear to me and it is drawn based on where the 6LoWPAN 
RFCs  are applicable.

Brian

Hi again,

You say that the distinction between 6lo and 6man is drawn based on where the
6LoWPAN RFCs are applicable.
Is it necessary to say, in the charter, where those RFCs are applicable?

Currently there is an attempt via "for link layer technologies of interest in
constrained node networks." But maybe you would only use the 6LoWPAN RFCs in
environments where they are applicable, in which case we can resolve by changing
to say...

OLD
6Lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node
networks, as the term is defined by the LWIG working group.
NEW
6Lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for IPv6 adaptation
using technologies previously described by the 6LoWPAN working group.
END

and

OLD
1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies
(RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in
constrained node networks
NEW
1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies
(RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775).
END

Adrian

So, *I* think this change is a little problematic.  As a data point, 
there are components of the 6LoWPAN work that are being proposed for 
inclusion in the base IPv6 specifications (e.g., 
draft-chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd).  That draft takes changes 
made to NDP for these "constrained node networks" and applies them to 
all link layers, including Ethernet.  Dropping that descriptor from the 
charter would essentially allow 6lo to work on any link layer technology.

Regards,
Brian

Looking at the list of candidate documents from Carsten's BoF =
presentation, this revised text looks OK.  It fits around those =
candidate documents, as long as "technologies previously described by =
the 6LoWPAN working group" is interpreted liberally enough to allow =
modifications to the technologies as required by the specific =
adaptation.

and I agree with Brian that work like =
draft-chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd, which applies to all link =

                  The key work is extending the 6LoWPAN RFCs to other

                            My main concern is that it is not
                            appropriate for a charter to give, as a<br>
                            key<br>
                            reference scoping its work, a pointer to an
                            Internet-Draft. &nbsp;This is not<br>
                            only<br>
                            the case because I-Ds contain boiler-plate
                            saying that it is<br>
                            inappropriate to<br>
                            cite them, but also because the definitions
                            in the referenced I-D are<br>
                            currently<br>
                            under debate and the subject of an IESG

                            My other concerns are considerably addressed
                            by the last two paragraphs,<br>
                            but<br>
                            would, I think benefit from some
                            word-smithing...<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            "IPv6-over-foo specifications" is
                            particularly loose. &nbsp;TCP is an<br>
                            IP-over-foo<br>
                            technology. &nbsp;Can the proposed working gr=
oup
                            work on it? &nbsp;What about<br>
                            enhancements<br>
                            to TCP to take account of the constrained
                            nature of the under-lying<br>
                            network?<br>
                            <br>
                            It is possible that this work is intended to
                            be scoped to foo being one<br>
                            of the<br>
                            technologies covered by RFC4944, RFC6282,
                            RFC6775, but that is not<br>
                            clear.<br>

                          Maybe "common infrastructure" has a specific
                          meaning in the Internet<br>
                          Area, but<br>
                          some people might assume that a routing
                          protocol was a common<br>
                          infrastructure :-)<br>
                          I would, for example, consider mesh-under
                          routing protocols to be suspect<br>
                          within<br>
                          this scope, but would find it hard to scope
                          them out witthese words.<br>

                          If you have other things in mind, it might be
                          good to list them. If<br>
                          header<br>
                          compression is the only one, then perhaps
                          change the to talk only about<br>
                          that.<br>
                          <br>
                          Maybe also be careful to narrow down which
                          headers you mean.<br>

Is it possible to scope the work using a definition of 6LoWPAN rather 
than the definitions in the LWIG draft?  Adrian holds a DISCUSS on the 
LWIG draft because of the scoping of those definitions.  He proposed 
that the 6lo charter avoid those definitions by scoping its work based 
on some 6LoWPAN description/definition.

Thoughts?  Proposed text?

Brian

on some 6LoWPAN description/definition.

The narrow definition of 6LoWPAN is that of "IP-over-foo for IEEE =
802.15.4".  We can't use that.

The wider explanation in the LWIG draft:

   One interesting class of a constrained network often used as a
   constrained node network is the "LoWPAN" [RFC4919], a term inspired
   from the name of the IEEE 802.15.4 working group (low-rate wireless
   personal area networks (LR-WPANs)).  [...]
   Originally focused on IEEE 802.15.4, "LoWPAN" (or when used for IPv6,
   "6LoWPAN") is now also being used for networks built from similarly
   constrained link layer technologies [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-btle]
   [I-D.mariager-6lowpan-v6over-dect-ule] [I-D.brandt-6man-lowpanz].

So it refers back to "constrained", but without using the other =
definitions in the LWIG terminology.

Hi,

I haven't had a chance to do a thorough read though, however I haven't been=
 able to find where the following scenarios is dealt with.=A0

In a pure energy efficient scenario, say there are two NEAR routers on the =
link (NEAR1, NEAR2). An EAH host (EAH1) at bootstrap chooses NEAR1, registe=
rs its addresses and uses NEAR1 as its egress router for off-link traffic. =
For the return traffic (i.e, off-link traffic coming onto the energy effici=
ent segment), what occurs if the upstream network chooses to use NEAR2 to t=
ry to forward traffic to EAH1, as the upstream network considers NEAR2 rath=
er than NEAR1 to be closer to EAH1 e.g, because of a smaller IGP metric, or=
 the traffic source link is directly attached to NEAR2?

=3D=3D=3D> You are right. The document does not clearly handles this case. =
 However implicitly, an EAH can register with multiple routers in the netwo=
rk. But in order to add router policies ( in this case NEAR1 forwards north=
bound-only, NEAR2 forwards southbound only)  and synchronize that with EAH,=
 it needs some more work [ perhaps some additional option with the registra=
tion]. Pascal has indicated the backbone router draft function.
This document tries to be generic and provides hooks for further enhancemen=
t for constrained nodes running IPv6.


In my understanding, NEAR2 wouldn't have knowledge of EAH1, because EAH1 ha=
s only been registered with NEAR1. So it would seem that currently the only=
 choice is for NEAR2 to drop those packets.

=3D=3D=3D> Please see above.

Further to this two or more NEAR scenario, even if the upstream network alw=
ays considers NEAR1 to be the closer to the EAHs, if the NEARs are protecte=
d by a redundancy protocol such as VRRP, when VRRP switches from using NEAR=
1 to NEAR2, how does NEAR2 acquire address registration information? Would =
it be considered a EAH bootstrap event, so that all of the EAHs have to go =
through selection and then registration of a NEAR? While I think that would=
 work, it would seem to be defeating the purpose of having a redundancy pro=
tocol like VRRP which tries to make switching over between routers nearly i=
f not ideally transparent to downstream hosts.

=3D=3D=3D> We have not thought about interaction with VRRP. Good point.  We=
 should discuss that off-line to  understand the scenario and its applicabi=
lity in this document.


Best regards,
-Samita

Hi All,

There have been a lot of discussion in the list and I am catching up with t=
hem.

Here are some proposed text for the charter and some thoughts ( as per the =
following email  from Brian ) .

CURRENT


 6Lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node
networks, as the term is defined by the LWIG working group.=20

NEW:

6Lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node Netwo=
rks. The constrained node networks have  limited functionality compared to =
the  common IP networks composed of line-powered and high-capacity devices.=
 An example of constrained networks is IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4(6LoWPAN).
The constrained nodes can be characterized by many different categories suc=
h as node capability, cost of networks, media constraints, regulatory limit=
s, bit-rates etc.=20


CURRENT
6Lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area work. 6Lo does not take=
 on
larger cross-layer efforts. The working group will continue to reuse existi=
ng
protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

QUESTION:  Would like to know what we mean by "small focused pieces of Inte=
rnet Area work" ?

Would it be better to say "6Lo will work on focused pieces of Internet Area=
 for which the work already started=20
on the IPv6-over-foo and provide generic guidelines for IPv6 running on con=
strained link-layers".

Will this group develop any work on provisioning of the constrained nodes? =
Gateway devices between Internet (IPv6) and  constrained networks?
If so,  it would be good to clarify them.

CURRENT:
Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers being
worked on is out of scope.

QUESTION: Is it trying to say?

Any new security and management work that is not specific to the constraine=
d link, is out of scope.
This sentence is not clear to me.


The rest looks fine to me.

Thanks,
-Samita

Is it possible to scope the work using a definition of 6LoWPAN rather than =
the definitions in the LWIG draft?  Adrian holds a DISCUSS on the LWIG draf=
t because of the scoping of those definitions.  He proposed that the 6lo ch=
arter avoid those definitions by scoping its work based on some 6LoWPAN des=
cription/definition.

Thoughts?  Proposed text?

Hi Samita,

Comments inline.

To summarise: I think we are going around in circles re. "constrained"=20
terms and I support Ulrich's suggestion to copy the terms from=20
draft-ietf-lwig-terminology verbatim.

<RCC>I think we are going around in circles here. I support Ulrich's=20
suggestion to simply copy the definitions from=20
draft-ietf-lwig-terminology. On the basis that it is almost impossible=20
to provide a definitive objective statement about what a "constrained"=20
anything is, I think the terms in draft-ietf-lwig-terminology are well=20
considered and well qualified. Whilst the qualifications are dealt with=20
more in the LWIG WG, the charter states that there will be coordination=20
with LWIG, so I don't see what else needs to be done for this.</RCC>

<RCC>The suggested text seems to preclude starting work for other=20
as-yet-to-be-determined link layers applicable to constrained node=20
networks, which would not be the case, surely? "small, focused pieces of =

Internet Area work" is clear enough to me.</RCC>

<RCC>
I would rather not bring in another "constrained" term here. I think the =

sentence as it stands is OK - a possible change which may clarify would=20
be something like:

"Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers=20
under consideration is out of scope."
