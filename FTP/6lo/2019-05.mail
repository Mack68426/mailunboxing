Summary:

       This draft is on the right track but has open issues, described
       in the review.

There are a number of comments about the exposition that are listed
below.  I'm sure these can be resolved by the authors.  But there is a
serious problem with the last 5 paragraphs of section 8,
"Synchronization Aspects":  they seem to assume that the time
representation for the Deadline Time and Origination Time values will
wrap around, that is, that the representation is the absolute value
modulo the size of the field.  In addition, there is a lack of clarity
how the new epoch point will be chosen after the value wraps around.
This seems to contradict the earlier sections of the document which
speak of the values as if they are always to be considered as absolute
values on a time scale selected by the TU field, viz., either the NTP
time scale (in seconds) or the network's ASN numbering.

It's possible that four of these paragraphs are intended to only apply
to the use of TU = 00, the NTP time scale, and perhaps that usage of
the header is understood not to be completely specified yet.

However, the final paragraph discusses TU = 10 (the ASN time scale),
and claims that wrapping of the DT value is intended.  This is
relevant to current implementations.

Some sort of resolution of this is needed; as the document stands it
is self-inconsistent.  One possible resolution would be to omit these
paragraphs.

Nits/editorial comments:

                          Figure 1: 6LoRHE format

   o  Length: Length of the 6LoRHE expressed in bytes, excluding the
      first 2 bytes.  This enables a node to skip a 6LoRHE if the Type
      is not recognized/supported.

   o  Type (variable length): Type of the 6LoRHE (see Section 7)

There is a detail of this description which I don't like, and the
problem seems to be inherited from draft-ietf-roll-routing-dispatch,
viz., there is a variable-length field in the 6LoRHE, but it's not
named or described as such in that figure.  The correct way to
describe the header is:

      0                   1
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

   4.  Deadline-6LoRHE

   Since the OTD is a delta the
   length of the OTD field (i.e., OTL) will require fewer bits than the
   length of the DT field (i.e., DTL).

Strictly speaking, it will usually require fewer bits.  OTOH, it will
often require far fewer bits.  Also, given the placement of "(i.e.,
OTL)" there is an awkwardness regarding whether "OTL" is an
abbreviation for "the length of the OTD field" or an abbreviation for
"the OTD field".  Conveniently, even a difference of 1 in the length
fields is significant, since they are in units of 4 bits.  So perhaps
a better wording is:

   Since the OTD is a delta, the length (i.e., OTL) of the OTD field
   will often be less than the length (i.e., DTL) of the DT field.

--

   5.  Deadline-6LoRHE Format

   o  TU (2 bits) : Indicates the time units for DT and OTD fields.  The
      encoding for the DT and OTD fields MUST always use the same time
      units and precision.

      *  00 : Time represented in seconds and fractional seconds
      *  01 : Reserved
      *  10 : Network ASN
      *  11 : Reserved

I think these could be made more explicit:

   o  TU (2 bits) : Indicates the time unit and zero point for DT and
      OTD fields.  The encoding for the DT and OTD fields MUST always
      use the same time units and precision.

      *  00 : Time represented in seconds and fractional seconds,
              with 0 being the epoch of the NTP time scale,
              00:00:00 1 January 1900 UTC [RFC5905].
      *  01 : Reserved
      *  10 : Network ASN
      *  11 : Reserved

Although there should be a warning that the NTP time scale has a
discontinuity whenever there is a leap second, so further
specification will be needed before the NTP time scale can be used in
delay-critical networks.

--

   o  Binary Pt (6 bits) : If zero, the number of bits of the integer
      part the DT is equal to the number of bits of the fractional part
      of the DT.  if nonzero, the Binary Pt is a signed integer
      determining the position of the binary point within the value for
      the DT.

      *  If BinaryPt value is positive, then the number of bits for the
         integer part of the DT is increased by the value of BinaryPt,
         and the number of bits for the fractional part of the DT is
         correspondingly reduced.  This increases the range of DT.
      *  If BinaryPt value is negative, then the number of bits for the
         integer part of the DT is decreased by the value of BinaryPt,
         and the number of bits for the fractional part of the DT is
         correspondingly increased.  This increases the precision of the
         fractional seconds part of DT.

It seems like this could be stated much more succinctly.  Also, the
signed integer format for Binary Pt needs to be specified.  E.g.,

   o  Binary Pt (6 bits):  A signed, twos-complement integer giving
      the placement of the binary point in the DT field:  
      the number of integral bits is 2*(DTL+1) + BinaryPt
      the number of fractional bits is 2*(DTL+1) - BinaryPt

--

The scaling of the OTD value should be made explicit, as I see it as
an opportunity for errors:

   o  OTD Value (8..64-bit) : An unsigned integer of OTL hex digits
      giving the Origination Time as a negative offset from the DT value.
      The rightmost bit of OTD has the same units as the rightmost bit
      of DT.

Then again, it's possible that the working group intended a different
scaling rule for OTD.

For completeness, there should be a statement that if OTL+DTL is even,
then there will be a one-hex digit pad at the end of the value.

   8.  Synchronization Aspects

   The document supports time representation of the deadline and
   origination times carried in the packets traversing through networks
   of different time zones having different time synchronization
   mechanisms.  For instance, in a 6TiSCH network where the time is
   maintained as ASN time slots, the time synchronization is achieved
   through beaconing among the nodes as described in [RFC7554].  There
   could be 6lo networks that employ NTP where the nodes are
   synchronized with an external reference clock from an NTP server.
   The specification of the time synchronization method that need to be
   followed by a network is beyond the scope of the document.

   The number of hex digits chosen to represent DT, and the portion of
   that field allocated to represent integer number of seconds,
   determines the meaning of t_0, i.e., the meaning of DT == 0 in the
   chosen representation.

It's not clear to me why "the portion of that field allocated to
represent integer number of seconds" affects the meaning of the zero
DT value.  Doesn't DT == 0 always represent the zero point of the time
scale selected by TU, regardless of the value of BinaryPt?

   If DTL == 0, then there are only 4 bits that
   can be used to count the time units, so that DT == 0 can never be
   more than 16 time units in the past.  This then requires that the
   time synchronization between sender and receiver has to be tighter
   than 16 time units.  If the binary point were moved so that all the
   bits were used for fractional time units (e.g., fractional seconds or
   fractional ASNs), the time synchronization requirement would be
   correspondingly tighter.

This paragraph is unclear to me.  Presumably, the network will be
running for a long time (many time units) so the DT values will get
quite large.  I suspect that the first sentence was to start "If OTL
== 1 ..." and then OT can never be more than 16 time units in the
past.  In practice, this means that time synchronization has to be
tighter than 16 time units, or receivers will start randomly receiving
packets with DT in the past or OT in the future.

   A 4-bit field for DT allows up to 16 hex digits, which is 64 bits.
   That is enough to represent the NTP [RFC5905] 64-bit timestamp
   format, which is more than enough for the purposes of establishing
   deadline times.  Unless the binary point is moved, this is enough to
   represent time since year 1900.

If the binary point is not moved, this format can represent time from
year 1900 to year 2036, which is less than the expected lifetime of
this protocol.  But BinaryPt >= 1 allows representing time until year
2172, which should be adequate.

   For example, suppose that DTL = 0b0000 and the DT bits are split
   evenly; then we can count up to 3 integer seconds.  In that case t_0
   would be the most recent second of the current minute that has
   t mod 4 == 0.  In other words, t_0 could be 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, ..., 52,
   or 56 seconds since the start of the most recent minute.  The
   networks have to be synchronized well enough to ensure detection of
   overrun, and therefore to know which of those values is the correct
   value for t_0.  This is the hardest case.

   If DT = 3 and the DT bits are again split evenly, then we can count
   up to 4,096 seconds.  t_0 would be the start of the most recent hour.

Where does this come from?  I see no specification of DT containing
(deadline_time mod 2^(number of bits)).  If a certain number of hex
digits is not large enough to express the time since the zero point of
the chosen time scale, DTL needs to be increased.

Also, it's entirely unclear why, if truncating the high-order bits of
DT was defined, the beginning of each minute or hour would be chosen
as zero points.

   For TU = 0b00, the time units are seconds.  With DTL == 15, and
   Binary Pt == 0, the epoch is (by default) January 1, 1900 at 00:00
   UTC.  The resolution is then (2 ^ (- 32)) seconds, which is the
   maximum possible.

BinaryPt can represent -32, which with DTL == 15, allows a resolution
of 2^-64 seconds (albeit for only 1 second after the zero point).

   This time format wraps around every 2^32 seconds,
   which is roughly 136 years.

There being no provision for time values wrapping around, the only
solution would be to move the binary point to the right.

   For other choices of DTL and the Binary
   Pt, the value of t_0 (i.e., the meaning of DT == 0) needs to be
   established by means out of scope of this document.

   For TU = 0b10, the time units are ASNs.  The start time is relative,
   and updated by a mechanism out of scope for this document.  With 10
   ms slots, DTL = 15, and Binary Pt == 0, it would take over a year for
   the ASN to wrap around.  Typically, the number of hex digits
   allocated for TU = 0b10 would be less than 15.

Hi,

Here is a review of Pascal's draft on fragment recovery. The protocol will
improve the performances of fragmentation in case of some fragment are lost
during transit. Flow control should be more detailed, it was not clear to
me when Y bit has to be sent.

My comments are in-line.

Laurent

1.  Introduction

   In most Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) applications, the bulk of
   the traffic consists of small chunks of data (in the order few bytes
   to a few tens of bytes) at a time.  Given that an IEEE Std. 802.15.4
   [IEEE.802.15.4] frame can carry 74 bytes or more in all cases,
   fragmentation is usually not required.  However, and though this
   happens only occasionally, a number of mission critical applications
   do require the capability to transfer larger chunks of data, for
   instance to support a firmware upgrades of the LLN nodes or an
   extraction of logs from LLN nodes.  In the former case, the large
   chunk of data is transferred to the LLN node, whereas in the latter,
   the large chunk flows away from the LLN node.  In both cases, the
   size can be on the order of 10Kbytes or more and an end-to-end
   reliable transport is required.

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


   "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944]
   defines the original 6LoWPAN datagram fragmentation mechanism for
   LLNs.  One critical issue with this original design is that routing
   an IPv6 [RFC8200] packet across a route-over mesh requires to
   reassemble the full packet at each hop, which may cause latency along
   a path and an overall buffer bloat in the network.  The "6TiSCH
   Architecture" [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] recommends to use a hop-
   by-hop fragment forwarding technique to alleviate those undesirable
   effects.  "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding"
   [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment] proposes such a technique, in a
   fashion that is compatible with [RFC4944] without the need to define
   a new protocol.  However, adding that capability alone to the local
   implementation of the original 6LoWPAN fragmentation would not
   address the

bulk of the issues raised against it, and may create new
   issues like remnant state in the network.

LT: can you specify or give some references.

   Another issue against [RFC4944] is that it does not define a
   mechanism to first discover the loss of a fragment along a multi-hop
   path (e.g. having exhausted the link-layer retries at some hop on the
   way), and then to recover that loss.  With RFC 4944, the forwarding
   of a whole datagram fails when one fragment is not delivered properly
   to the destination 6LoWPAN endpoint.  End-to-end transport or
   application-level mechanisms may require a full retransmission of the
   datagram, wasting resources in an already constrained network.

   In that situation, the source 6LoWPAN endpoint will not be aware that
   a loss occurred and will continue sending all fragments for a
   datagram that is already doomed.  The original support is missing
   signaling to abort a multi-fragment transmission at any time and from
   either end, and, if the capability to forward fragments is
   implemented, clean up the related state in the network.  It is also
   lacking flow control capabilities to avoid participating to a
   congestion that may in turn cause the loss of a fragment and trigger
   the retransmission of the full datagram.

   This specification proposes a method to forward fragments across a
   multi-hop route-over mesh, and to recover individual fragments
   between LLN endpoints.  The method is designed to limit congestion
   loss in the network and addresses the requirements that are detailed
   in Appendix B.

   lost fragments can lead to poor network behavior and, occasionally,
   trouble at application layer.  The reader is encouraged to read "IPv4
   Reassembly Errors at High Data Rates" [RFC4963] and follow the
   references for more information.

   That experience led to the definition of "Path MTU discovery"
   [RFC8201] (PMTUD) protocol that limits fragmentation over the
   Internet.

   Specifically in the case of UDP, valuable additional information can
   be found in "UDP Usage Guidelines for Application Designers"
   [RFC8085].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and
   Goals" [RFC4919] and "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   Networks" [RFC4944].

   "The Benefits of Using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)"
   [RFC8087] provides useful information on the potential benefits and
   pitfalls of using ECN.

   Quoting the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Architecture"
   [RFC3031]: with MPLS, "packets are "labeled" before they are
   forwarded.  At subsequent hops, there is no further analysis of the
   packet's network layer header.  Rather, the label is used as an index
   into a table which specifies the next hop, and a new label".  The
   MPLS technique is leveraged in the present specification to forward
   fragments that actually do not have a network layer header, since the
   fragmentation occurs below IP.

   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the
   datagram_tag as a label in a fashion similar to MLPS.  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

2.5.  New Terms

   This specification uses the following terms:

   6LoWPAN endpoints

      The LLN nodes in charge of generating or expanding a 6LoWPAN
      header from/to a full IPv6 packet.  The 6LoWPAN endpoints are the
      points where fragmentation and reassembly take place.

3.  Updating RFC 4944

   This specification updates the fragmentation mechanism that is
   specified in "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   Networks" [RFC4944] for use in route-over LLNs by providing a model
   where fragments can be forwarded end-to-end across a 6LoWPAN LLN, and
   where fragments that are lost on the way can be recovered
   individually.  A new format for fragment is introduces and new
   dispatch types are defined in Section 5.

   [RFC8138] allows to modifies the size of a packet en-route by
   removing the consumed hops in a compressed Routing Header.  It
   results that the fragment_offset and datagram_size cannot be signaled
   in the uncompressed form.  This specification expresses those fields
   in the compressed form and allows to modify them en-route (see
   Section 4.2.

   Note that consistantly with in Section 2 of [RFC6282] for the
   fragmentation mechanism described in Section 5.3 of [RFC4944], any

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


   header that cannot fit within the first fragment MUST NOT be
   compressed when using the fragmentation mechanism described in this
   specification.

4.  Updating draft-watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment

   This specification updates the fragment forwarding mechanism
   specified in "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding"
   [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment] by providing additional
   operations to improve the management of the Virtual Reassembly Buffer
   (VRB).

4.1.  Slack in the First Fragment

   At the time of this writing, [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   allows for refragmenting in intermediate nodes, meaning that some
   bytes from a given fragment may be left in the VRB to be added to the
   next fragment.  The reason for this to happen would be the need for
   space in the outgoing fragment that was not needed in the incoming
   fragment, for instance because the 6LoWPAN Header Compression is not
   as efficient on the outgoing link, e.g., if the Interface ID (IID) of
   the source IPv6 address is elided by the originator on the first hop
   because it matches the source MAC address, but cannot be on the next
   hops because the source MAC address changes.

   This specification cannot allow this operation since fragments are
   recovered end-to-end based on the fragment number.  This means that
   the fragments that contain a 6LoWPAN-compressed header MUST have
   enough slack to enable a less efficient compression in the next hops
   that still fits in one MAC frame.  For instance, if the IID of the
   source IPv6 address is elided by the originator, then it MUST compute
   the fragment_size as if the MTU was 8 bytes less.  This way, the next
   hop can restore the source IID to the first fragment without
   impacting the second fragment.

4.2.  Modifying the First Fragment

   The compression of the Hop Limit, of the source and destination
   addresses, and of the Routing Header may change en route in a Route-
   Over mesh LLN.  If the size of the first fragment is modified, then
   the intermediate node MUST adapt the datagram_size to reflect that
   difference.

   The intermediate node MUST also save the difference of datagram_size
   of the first fragment in the VRB, and add it to the datagram_size and
   to the fragment_offset of all the subsequent fragments for that
   datagram.

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


5.  New Dispatch types and headers

   This specification enables the 6LoWPAN fragmentation sublayer to
   provide an MTU up to 2048 bytes to the upper layer, which can be the
   6LoWPAN Header Compression sublayer that is defined in the
   "Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams" [RFC6282] specification.  In
   order to achieve this, this specification enables the fragmentation
   and the reliable transmission of fragments over a multihop 6LoWPAN
   mesh network.

   This specification provides a technique that is derived from MPLS in
   order to forward individual fragments across a 6LoWPAN route-over
   mesh.  The datagram_tag is used as a label; it is locally unique to
   the node that is the source MAC address of the fragment, so together
   the MAC address and the label can identify the fragment globally.  A
   node may build the datagram_tag in its own locally-significant way,
   as long as the selected tag stays unique to the particular datagram
   for the lifetime of that datagram.  It results that the label does
   not need to be globally unique but also that it must be swapped at
   each hop as the source MAC address changes.

   This specification extends RFC 4944 [RFC4944] with 4 new Dispatch
   types, for Recoverable Fragment (RFRAG) headers with or without
   Acknowledgment Request (RFRAG vs. RFRAG-ARQ), and for the RFRAG
   Acknowledgment back, with or without ECN Echo (RFRAG-ACK vs. RFRAG-
   ECHO).

   (to be confirmed by IANA) The new 6LoWPAN Dispatch types use the
   Value Bit Pattern of 11 1010xx from page 0 [RFC8025], as follows:

              Pattern    Header Type
            +------------+------------------------------------------+
            | 11  101000 | RFRAG       - Recoverable Fragment       |
            | 11  101001 | RFRAG-ARQ   - RFRAG with Ack Request     |
            | 11  101010 | RFRAG-ACK   - RFRAG Acknowledgment       |
            | 11  101011 | RFRAG-ECHO  - RFRAG Ack with ECN Echo    |
            +------------+------------------------------------------+


LT: This space is marked experimental use by IANA. Why not select a value
in another page (rfc 8025).

             Figure 1: Additional Dispatch Value Bit Patterns

   In the following sections, the semantics of "datagram_tag" are
   unchanged from [RFC4944] Section 5.3.

LT: I disagree on the world semantic, since the datagram tag is changed hop
by hop. The receiver does not receive the one sent by the originator. It
could be said that dtag is used to identify fragments belonging to a same
packet, but the value by itself is changed during the fragment transmission=

5.1.  Recoverable Fragment Dispatch type and Header

   In this specification, the size and offset of the fragments are
   expressed on the compressed packet form as opposed to the
   uncompressed - native - packet form.

   The first fragment is recognized by a sequence of 0; it carries its
   fragment_size and the datagram_size of the compressed packet, whereas
   the other fragments carry their fragment_size and fragment_offset.
   The last fragment for a datagram is recognized when its
   fragment_offset and its fragment_size add up to the datagram_size.

LT: The format of intermediary fragment is not clear to me, do you have
only DTAG and sequence? Why fragment size is necessary is it to remove
padding? Why do you need to have offset and sequence, are they redundant?
Do you authorize overlapping fragments ? Can sequence be obtain as
fragment_offset/fragment_size ?


   Recoverable Fragments are sequenced and a bitmap is used in the RFRAG
   Acknowledgment to indicate the received fragments by setting the
   individual bits that correspond to their sequence.

   E: 1 bit; Explicit Congestion Notification; the "E" flag is reset by
      the source of the fragment and set by intermediate routers to
      signal that this fragment experienced congestion along its path.

   Fragment_size:  10 bit unsigned integer; the size of this fragment in
      a unit that depends on the MAC layer technology.  For IEEE Std.
      802.15.4, the unit is octet, and the maximum fragment size, which
      is constrained by the maximum frame size of 128 octet minus the
      overheads of the MAC and Fragment Headers, is not limited by this
      encoding.

   X: 1 bit; Ack Requested: when set, the sender requires an RFRAG

   Sequence:  5 bit unsigned integer; the sequence number of the
      fragment.  Fragments are sequence numbered [0..N] where N is in
      [0..31].  A sequence of 0 indicates the first fragment in a
      datagram.  For IEEE Std. 802.15.4, as long as the overheads enable

      a fragment size of 64 octets or more, this enables to fragment a
      packet of 2047 octets.

   Fragment_offset:  16 bit unsigned integer;

      *  When set to a non-0 value, the semantics of the Fragment_offset
         depends on the value of the Sequence.

         +  When the Sequence is not 0, this field indicates the offset
            of the fragment in the compressed form.  The fragment should
            be forwarded based on an existing VRB as described in
            Section 7.2, or silently dropped if none is found.

         +  For a first fragment (i.e. with a sequence of 0), this field
            is overloaded to indicate the total_size of the compressed
            packet, to help the receiver allocate an adapted buffer for
            the reception and reassembly operations.  This format limits
            the maximum MTU on a 6LoWPAN link to 2047 bytes, but 1280
            bytes is the recommended value to avoid issues with IPv6
            Path MTU Discovery [RFC8201].  The fragment should be routed
            based on the destination IPv6 address, and an VRB state
            should be installed as described in Section 7.1.

      *  When set to 0, this field indicates an abort condition and all
         state regarding the datagram should be cleaned up once the
         processing of the fragment is complete; the processing of the
         fragment depends on whether there is a VRB already established
         for this datagram, and the next hop is still reachable:

         +  if a VRB already exists and is not broken, the fragment is
            to be forwarded along the associated Label Switched Path
            (LSP) as described in Section 7.2, but regardless of the
            value of the Sequence field;

         +  else, if the Sequence is 0, then the fragment is to be
            routed as described in Section 7.1 but no state is conserved
            afterwards.

LT: Not clear to me, the first point is an abort, but what is the purpose
of the second point. 7.1 is not explicit on that.

         If the fragment cannot be forwarded or routed, then an abort
         RFRAG-ACK is sent back to the source.

5.2.  RFRAG Acknowledgment Dispatch type and Header

   This specification also defines a 4-octet RFRAG Acknowledgment bitmap
   that is used by the reassembling end point to confirm selectively the
   reception of individual fragments.  A given offset in the bitmap maps
   one to one with a given sequence number.

      process is aborted.  All 1's is a FULL bitmap that indicates that
      the fragmentation process is complete, all fragments were received
      at the reassembly end point.

6.  Fragments Recovery

   The Recoverable Fragment headers RFRAG and RFRAG-ARQ are used to
   transport a fragment and optionally request an RFRAG Acknowledgment
   that will confirm the good reception of a one or more fragments.  An
   RFRAG Acknowledgment can optionally carry an ECN indication; it is
   carried as a standalone header in a message that is sent back to the
   6LoWPAN endpoint that was the source of the fragments, as known by
   its MAC address.  The process ensures that at every hop, the source
   MAC address and the datagram_tag in the received fragment are enough
   information to send the RFRAG Acknowledgment back towards the source
   6LoWPAN endpoint by reversing the MPLS operation.

   The 6LoWPAN endpoint that fragments the packets at 6LoWPAN level (the
   sender) also controls when the reassembling end point sends the RFRAG
   Acknowledgments by setting the Ack Requested flag in the RFRAG
   packets.  It may set the Ack Requested flag on any fragment to
   perform congestion control by limiting the number of outstanding
   fragments, which are the fragments that have been sent but for which
   reception or loss was not positively confirmed by the reassembling
   endpoint.  When the sender of the fragment knows that an underlying
   link-layer mechanism protects the Fragments, it may refrain from
   using the RFRAG Acknowledgment mechanism, and never set the Ack
   Requested bit.  When it receives a fragment with the ACK Request flag
   set, the 6LoWPAN endpoint that reassembles the packets at 6LoWPAN
   level (the receiver) sends back an RFRAG Acknowledgment to confirm
   reception of all the fragments it has received so far.

LT: What do you send when your packet has been entirely sent and the ACK
has not been received ?

   The sender transfers a controlled number of fragments and MAY flag
   the last fragment of a series with an RFRAG Acknowledgment Request.
   The receiver (typo)

MUST acknowledge a fragment with the acknowledgment
   request bit set.  If any fragment immediately preceding an
   acknowledgment request is still missing, the receiver MAY
   intentionally delay its acknowledgment to allow in-transit fragments
   to arrive.

LT: can you have such behavior if all the fragments follow the same path.

 Delaying the acknowledgment might defeat the round trip




Thubert                   Expires July 27, 2019                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


   delay computation so it should be configurable and not enabled by
   default.

   The receiver MAY issue unsolicited acknowledgments.  An unsolicited
   acknowledgment signals to the sender endpoint that it can resume
   sending if it had reached its maximum number of outstanding
   fragments.  Another use is to inform that the reassembling endpoint
   has canceled the process of an individual datagram.  Note that
   acknowledgments might consume precious resources so the use of
   unsolicited acknowledgments should be configurable and not enabled by
   default.

   An observation is that streamlining forwarding of fragments generally
   reduces the latency over the LLN mesh, providing room for retries
   within existing upper-layer reliability mechanisms.  The sender
   protects the transmission over the LLN mesh with a retry timer that
   is computed according to the method detailed in [RFC6298].  It is
   expected that the upper layer retries obey the recommendations in
   "UDP Usage Guidelines" [RFC8085], in which case a single round of
   fragment recovery should fit within the upper layer recovery timers.

   Fragments are sent in a round robin fashion: the sender sends all the
   fragments for a first time before it retries any lost fragment; lost
   fragments are retried in sequence, oldest first.  This mechanism
   enables the receiver to acknowledge fragments that were delayed in
   the network before they are actually retried.

   When a single frequency is used by contiguous hops, the sender should
   wait a reasonable amount of time between fragments so as to let a
   fragment progress a few hops and avoid hidden terminal issues.  This
   precaution is not required on channel hopping technologies such as
   Time Slotted CHannel Hopping (TSCH) [RFC6554]

   When the sender decides that a packet should be dropped and the
   fragmentation process canceled, it sends a pseudo fragment with the
   fragment_offset, sequence and fragment_size all set to 0, and no
   data.  Upon reception of this message, the receiver should clean up
   all resources for the packet associated to the datagram_tag.  If an
   acknowledgment is requested, the receiver responds with a NULL
   bitmap.

LT: How the cleanup is done is connectivity to the next hop is lost?

   The receiver might need to cancel the process of a fragmented packet
   for internal reasons, for instance if it is out of reassembly
   buffers, or considers that this packet is already fully reassembled
   and passed to the upper layer.  In that case, the receiver SHOULD
   indicate so to the sender with a NULL bitmap in a RFRAG
   Acknowledgment.  Upon an acknowledgment with a NULL bitmap, the

   sender endpoint MUST abort the transmission of the fragmented
   datagram.

7.  Forwarding Fragments

   It is assumed that the first Fragment is large enough to carry the
   IPv6 header and make routing decisions.  If that is not so, then this
   specification MUST NOT be used.

   This specification extends the Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB)
   technique to forward fragments with no intermediate reconstruction of
   the entire packet.  The first fragment carries the IP header and it
   is routed all the way from the fragmenting end point to the
   reassembling end point.  Upon the first fragment, the routers along
   the path install a label-switched path (LSP), and the following
   fragments are label-switched along that path.  As a consequence,
   alternate routes not possible for individual fragments.  The
   datagram_tag is used to carry the label, that is swapped at each hop.
   All fragments follow the same path and fragments are delivered in the
   order at which they are sent.

7.1.  Upon the first fragment

   In Route-Over mode, the source and destination MAC addressed in a
   frame change at each hop.  The label that is formed and placed in the
   datagram_tag is associated to the source MAC and only valid (and
   unique) for that source MAC.  Upon a first fragment (i.e. with a
   sequence of zero), a VRB and the associated LSP state are created for
   the tuple (source MAC address, datagram_tag) and the fragment is
   forwarded along the IPv6 route that matches the destination IPv6
   address in the IPv6 header as prescribed by
   [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment].  The LSP state enables to match
   the (previous MAC address, datagram_tag) in an incoming fragment to
   the tuple (next MAC address, swapped datagram_tag) used in the
   forwarded fragment and points at the VRB.  In addition, the router
   also forms a Reverse LSP state indexed by the MAC address of the next
   hop and the swapped datagram_tag.  This reverse LSP state also points
   at the VRB and enables to match the (next MAC address,
   swapped_datagram_tag) found in an RFRAG Acknowledgment to the tuple
   (previous MAC address, datagram_tag) used when forwarding a Fragment
   Acknowledgment (RFRAG-ACK) back to the sender endpoint.

7.2.  Upon the next fragments

   Upon a next fragment (i.e. with a non-zero sequence), the router
   looks up a LSP indexed by the tuple (MAC address, datagram_tag) found
   in the fragment.  If it is found, the router forwards the fragment

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


   using the associated VRB as prescribed by
   [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment].

   if the VRB for the tuple is not found, the router builds an RFRAG-ACK
   to abort the transmission of the packet.  The resulting message has
   the following information:

   o  The source and destination MAC addresses are swapped from those
      found in the fragment

   o  The datagram_tag set to the datagram_tag found in the fragment

   o  A null bitmap is used to signal the abort condition

   At this point the router is all set and can send the RFRAG-ACK back
   to the previous router.  The RFRAG-ACK should normally be forwarded
   all the way to the source using the reverse LSP state in the VRBs in
   the intermediate routers as described in the next section.

7.3.  Upon the RFRAG Acknowledgments

   Upon an RFRAG-ACK, the router looks up a Reverse LSP indexed by the
   tuple (MAC address, datagram_tag), which are respectively the source
   MAC address of the received frame and the received datagram_tag.  If
   it is found, the router forwards the fragment using the associated
   VRB as prescribed by [I-D.watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment], but using
   the Reverse LSP so that the RFRAG-ACK flows back to the sender
   endpoint.

   If the Reverse LSP is not found, the router MUST silently drop the
   RFRAG-ACK message.

   Either way, if the RFRAG-ACK indicates either an error (NULL bitmap)
   or that the fragment was entirely received (FULL bitmap), arms a
   short timer, and upon timeout, the VRB and all associate state are
   destroyed.  During that time, fragments of that datagram may still be
   received, e.g. if the RFRAG-ACK was lost on the way back and the
   source retried the last fragment.  In that case, the router sends an
   abort RFRAG-ACK along the Reverse LSP to complete the clean up.

LT: what happens if the routing is not changing, but the modulation is
changing to shorten the MTU ?


8.  Security Considerations

   The process of recovering fragments does not appear to create any
   opening for new threat compared to "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over
   IEEE 802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944].

Appendix A.  Rationale

   There are a number of uses for large packets in Wireless Sensor
   Networks.  Such usages may not be the most typical or represent the
   largest amount of traffic over the LLN; however, the associated
   functionality can be critical enough to justify extra care for
   ensuring effective transport of large packets across the LLN.

   The list of those usages includes:

   Towards the LLN node:

      Firmware update:  For example, a new version of the LLN node
         software is downloaded from a system manager over unicast or
         multicast services.  Such a reflashing operation typically
         involves updating a large number of similar LLN nodes over a
         relatively short period of time.

      Packages of Commands:  A number of commands or a full
         configuration can be packaged as a single message to ensure
         consistency and enable atomic execution or complete roll back.
         Until such commands are fully received and interpreted, the
         intended operation will not take effect.

   From the LLN node:

      Waveform captures:  A number of consecutive samples are measured
         at a high rate for a short time and then transferred from a
         sensor to a gateway or an edge server as a single large report.

      Data logs:  LLN nodes may generate large logs of sampled data for
         later extraction.  LLN nodes may also generate system logs to
         assist in diagnosing problems on the node or network.

      Large data packets:  Rich data types might require more than one
         fragment.

   Uncontrolled firmware download or waveform upload can easily result
   in a massive increase of the traffic and saturate the network.

   When a fragment is lost in transmission, the lack of recovery in the
   original fragmentation system of RFC 4944 implies that all fragments
   are resent, further contributing to the congestion that caused the
   initial loss, and potentially leading to congestion collapse.

   This saturation may lead to excessive radio interference, or random
   early discard (leaky bucket) in relaying nodes.  Additional queuing




Thubert                   Expires July 27, 2019                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


   and memory congestion may result while waiting for a low power next
   hop to emerge from its sleeping state.

   Considering that RFC 4944 defines an MTU is 1280 bytes and that in
   most incarnations (but 802.15.4g) a IEEE Std. 802.15.4 frame can
   limit the MAC payload to as few as 74 bytes, a packet might be
   fragmented into at least 18 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.
   Taking into account the worst-case header overhead for 6LoWPAN
   Fragmentation and Mesh Addressing headers will increase the number of
   required fragments to around 32.  This level of fragmentation is much
   higher than that traditionally experienced over the Internet with
   IPv4 fragments.  At the same time, the use of radios increases the
   probability of transmission loss and Mesh-Under techniques compound
   that risk over multiple hops.

   Mechanisms such as TCP or application-layer segmentation could be
   used to support end-to-end reliable transport.  One option to support
   bulk data transfer over a frame-size-constrained LLN is to set the
   Maximum Segment Size to fit within the link maximum frame size.
   Doing so, however, can add significant header overhead to each
   802.15.4 frame.  In addition, deploying such a mechanism requires
   that the end-to-end transport is aware of the delivery properties of
   the underlying LLN, which is a layer violation, and difficult to
   achieve from the far end of the IPv6 network.

Appendix B.  Requirements

   For one-hop communications, a number of Low Power and Lossy Network
   (LLN) link-layers propose a local acknowledgment mechanism that is
   enough to detect and recover the loss of fragments.  In a multihop
   environment, an end-to-end fragment recovery mechanism might be a
   good complement to a hop-by-hop MAC level recovery.  This draft
   introduces a simple protocol to recover individual fragments between
   6LoWPAN endpoints that may be multiple hops away.  The method
   addresses the following requirements of a LLN:

   Number of fragments

      The recovery mechanism must support highly fragmented packets,
      with a maximum of 32 fragments per packet.

   Minimum acknowledgment overhead

      Because the radio is half duplex, and because of silent time spent
      in the various medium access mechanisms, an acknowledgment
      consumes roughly as many resources as data fragment.





Thubert                   Expires July 27, 2019                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


      The new end-to-end fragment recovery mechanism should be able to
      acknowledge multiple fragments in a single message and not require
      an acknowledgment at all if fragments are already protected at a
      lower layer.

   Controlled latency

      The recovery mechanism must succeed or give up within the time
      boundary imposed by the recovery process of the Upper Layer
      Protocols.

   Optional congestion control

      The aggregation of multiple concurrent flows may lead to the
      saturation of the radio network and congestion collapse.

      The recovery mechanism should provide means for controlling the
      number of fragments in transit over the LLN.

LT: Path is stable and communications are symmetrical

LT: MTU do not change during the fragmentation due to a modulation change.


Appendix C.  Considerations On Flow Control

   Considering that a multi-hop LLN can be a very sensitive environment
   due to the limited queuing capabilities of a large population of its
   nodes, this draft recommends a simple and conservative approach to
   congestion control, based on TCP congestion avoidance.

   Congestion on the forward path is assumed in case of packet loss, and
   packet loss is assumed upon time out.  The draft allows to control
   the number of outstanding fragments, that have been transmitted but
   for which an acknowledgment was not received yet.  It must be noted
   that the number of outstanding fragments should not exceed the number
   of hops in the network, but the way to figure the number of hops is
   out of scope for this document.

   Congestion on the forward path can also be indicated by an Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) mechanism.  Though whether and how ECN
   [RFC3168] is carried out over the LoWPAN is out of scope, this draft
   provides a way for the destination endpoint to echo an ECN indication
   back to the source endpoint in an acknowledgment message as
   represented in Figure 5 in Section 5.2.

   It must be noted that congestion and collision are different topics.
   In particular, when a mesh operates on a same channel over multiple
   hops, then the forwarding of a fragment over a certain hop may
   collide with the forwarding of a next fragment that is following over
   a previous hop but in a same interference domain.  This draft enables
   an end-to-end flow control, but leaves it to the sender stack to pace
   individual fragments within a transmit window, so that a given



Thubert                   Expires July 27, 2019                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft     6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery      January 2019


   fragment is sent only when the previous fragment has had a chance to
   progress beyond the interference domain of this hop.  In the case of
   6TiSCH [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture], which operates over the
   TimeSlotted Channel Hopping [RFC7554] (TSCH) mode of operation of
   IEEE802.14.5, a fragment is forwarded over a different channel at a
   different time and it makes full sense to transmit the next fragment
   as soon as the previous fragment has had its chance to be forwarded
   at the next hop.

   From the standpoint of a source 6LoWPAN endpoint, an outstanding
   fragment is a fragment that was sent but for which no explicit
   acknowledgment was received yet.  This means that the fragment might
   be on the way, received but not yet acknowledged, or the
   acknowledgment might be on the way back.  It is also possible that
   either the fragment or the acknowledgment was lost on the way.

   From the sender standpoint, all outstanding fragments might still be
   in the network and contribute to its congestion.  There is an
   assumption, though, that after a certain amount of time, a frame is
   either received or lost, so it is not causing congestion anymore.
   This amount of time can be estimated based on the round trip delay
   between the 6LoWPAN endpoints.  The method detailed in [RFC6298] is
   recommended for that computation.

   The reader is encouraged to read through "Congestion Control
   Principles" [RFC2914].  Additionally [RFC7567] and [RFC5681] provide
   deeper information on why this mechanism is needed and how TCP
   handles Congestion Control.  Basically, the goal here is to manage
   the amount of fragments present in the network; this is achieved by
   to reducing the number of outstanding fragments over a congested path
   by throttling the sources.

   Section 6 describes how the sender decides how many fragments are
   (re)sent before an acknowledgment is required, and how the sender
   adapts that number to the network conditions.

=C2=A0 In most Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) applications, the bulk of<=
br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 the traffic consists of small chunks of data (in the order =
few bytes<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 to a few tens of bytes) at a time.=C2=A0 Given th=
at an IEEE Std. 802.15.4<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 [IEEE.802.15.4] frame can carry 74=
 bytes or more in all cases,<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 fragmentation is usually not r=
equired.=C2=A0 However, and though this<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 happens only occasi=
onally, a number of mission critical applications<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 do requir=
e the capability to transfer larger chunks of data, for<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 ins=
tance to support a firmware upgrades of the LLN nodes or an<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=
 extraction of logs from LLN nodes.=C2=A0 In the former case, the large<br>=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 chunk of data is transferred to the LLN node, whereas in the l=
atter,<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 the large chunk flows away from the LLN node.=C2=A0 =
In both cases, the<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 size can be on the order of 10Kbytes or =
more and an end-to-end<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 reliable transport is required.<br><=

 January 2019<br><br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 &quot;Transmission of IPv6 Packets ov=
er IEEE 802.15.4 Networks&quot; [RFC4944]<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 defines the origi=
nal 6LoWPAN datagram fragmentation mechanism for<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 LLNs.=C2=
=A0 One critical issue with this original design is that routing<br>=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 an IPv6 [RFC8200] packet across a route-over mesh requires to<br>=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 reassemble the full packet at each hop, which may cause latency a=
long<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 a path and an overall buffer bloat in the network.=C2=
=A0 The &quot;6TiSCH<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 Architecture&quot; [I-D.ietf-6tisch-ar=
chitecture] recommends to use a hop-<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 by-hop fragment forwar=
ding technique to alleviate those undesirable<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 effects.=C2=
=A0 &quot;LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding&quot;<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 [I-D.wattey=
ne-6lo-minimal-fragment] proposes such a technique, in a<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 fa=
shion that is compatible with [RFC4944] without the need to define<br>=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 a new protocol.=C2=A0 However, adding that capability alone to th=
e local<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 implementation of the original 6LoWPAN fragmentatio=
n would not<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 address the <br><br>bulk of the issues raised a=
gainst it, and may create new<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 issues like remnant state in =
the network.<br><br>LT: can you specify or give some references. <br><br>=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 Another issue against [RFC4944] is that it does not define a<b=
r>=C2=A0=C2=A0 mechanism to first discover the loss of a fragment along a m=
ulti-hop<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 path (e.g. having exhausted the link-layer retries=
 at some hop on the<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 way), and then to recover that loss.=C2=
=A0 With RFC 4944, the forwarding<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 of a whole datagram fails=
 when one fragment is not delivered properly<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 to the destina=
tion 6LoWPAN endpoint.=C2=A0 End-to-end transport or<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 applic=
ation-level mechanisms may require a full retransmission of the<br>=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 datagram, wasting resources in an already constrained network.<br><b=
r>=C2=A0=C2=A0 In that situation, the source 6LoWPAN endpoint will not be a=
ware that<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 a loss occurred and will continue sending all fra=
gments for a<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 datagram that is already doomed.=C2=A0 The ori=
ginal support is missing<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 signaling to abort a multi-fragmen=
t transmission at any time and from<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 either end, and, if the=
 capability to forward fragments is<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 implemented, clean up t=
he related state in the network.=C2=A0 It is also<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 lacking f=
low control capabilities to avoid participating to a<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 conges=
tion that may in turn cause the loss of a fragment and trigger<br>=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 the retransmission of the full datagram.<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 This speci=
fication proposes a method to forward fragments across a<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 mu=
lti-hop route-over mesh, and to recover individual fragments<br>=C2=A0=C2=

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCUSS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This should be easy to explain and clear up, but I have to ask, as I don’t see
anything about it in the document: what deters entities from using this with a
short deadline time in order to get expedited delivery, when they don’t need
it?  How does this help a network if, ultimately, every transmission specifies
a very short deadline time?


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Introduction, please expand “BLE” on first use.

In “Terminology”, you’re citing RFC 8174, but not usng the new BCP 14
boilerplate from there.  Please copy/paste the new boilerplate.

— Section 5 —

The definition of “TU” is out of order; please move it so it’s in the same
order in the definitions as in the block.

Why is DTL the length *minus 1*?  Doesn’t that invite mistakes?  Is there a
reason not to make it the length, and to say that 0 is not a valid value?

Fundamentally, a small integer encoded into a bitfield is best encoded =
as a value starting from 0, instead of creating holes at the bottom =
*and* the top.  Also, in this case, the 4-bit value encoding DTL can be =
between 0 and 15, so the length in bits could be 0 to 60, which is not =
enough for 64 bits.
So adding one sounds fine, even if you believe holes are good. =20

But then, I don=E2=80=99t understand why both DT and OTD are said to be =
=E2=80=9C8..64=E2=80=9D bits =E2=80=94 that needs 15 possible values, =
not 16; OTL has only 3 bits (which cannot express 15 possible values, =
which are probably not needed anyway), and the example for OTL has a DT =
of 4 bits.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCUSS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The security consideration section have significant short comings as this
mechanism enables multiple ways to attack both the packet and the system to my
understanding. I would appreaciate your clarifications on these matters.

First of all by changing the dead-line so that it gets dropped because it is
already late, alternatively move the deadline time out further in time (later),
so that the forwarders may deliver it so late that the receiver considers it to
late.

Secondly, there is the question if extensive use of this header will cause
overload or affect the scheduling of packet transmission affect other traffic
negatively. There appear to exist potential for new ways of bad interflow
interactions here.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking at this mechanism it appears to me as something that should fit into a
frame work, but that is not explicitly given. The main reason I am raising that
is that it appears to not care about a number of interesting and challenging
questions for a mechanism like this. Questions that a particular framework can
take care of, or which any user of this mechanism would need to consider in
their deployment before they can determine if they can safely deploy it. It
might be that some of the questions have answers and I missed. In that case
please straighten me out. And if you have some additional document that
provides more detailed usage which discuss any of these issues I would
appreciate a pointer.

So quesitons that I got when reading this specification:

1. Are there any mechanism to provide feedback if the packets reach the
receiver in time? If the sender sets the deadline shorter than the minimal
one-way path delay, then all packets will be late. Will any feedback be
provided that this is happening? In cases D=1 this appear to be a recipe for a
black hole for the traffic. One can also end up in situation where a large
fraction of the packet are late.

2. Any mechanism that exist to determine what the expected latency are from
sender to receiver?

3. Are there any type of admittance or policy approval to use this mechanism?

4. What is the relationship between traffic with a dead-line and other traffic
without a dead-line. Are traffic with a dead-line implicitly allowed to
pre-empt other traffic or at least to delay it in its queue?

5. As Barry noted, what are the protection against missuse?

These are issue that a framework or architecture would consider, I note that
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-architecture/ include some
discussion of these topics. Still DETNET architecture appear more constrained
when it comes to usage than what this mechanism through its examples.

I support Magnus and Barry's Discuss. I would also like to see at least more
text in the security consideration section about potential attacks or risks
that can follow when the provided information is altered by another node or
provided in a mal-intended way.

Also it would be good to provide further information on how this deadline is
supposed to be used by the network as well as by the endpoint. How does an
endpoint decide about the right deadline? Does the endpoint need to know the
RTT? How can this impact routing and scheduling? Of course these things don't
have to be normatively specified, however, providing more information about the
intended use and assumption would probably be helpful for implementors to do
the right thing as well.

One more comment: The following normative statements should probably rather use
non-normative lower-case "should": “The packet SHOULD be delivered to the
Receiver before this time.” and “All nodes within the network SHOULD process
the Deadline-6LoRHE in order to support delay-sensitive deterministic
applications.” as they are rather implicit goals than an actionable requirement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCUSS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few small points (one is confusing enough to warrant a quick
discussion), but they affect clarity of the specification:

In Section 5:

   o  OTL (3 bits) : Length of OTD field as an unsigned 3-bit integer,
      encoding the length of the field in hex digits.  If OTL == 0, the
      OTD field is not present.  The value of OTL MUST NOT exceed the
      value of DTL plus one.

      *  For example, DTL = 0b0000 means the deadline time in the 6LoRHE
         is 1 hex digit (4 bits) long.

Ok, so 0b0000 ==> (0 + 1) * 4, means 4 bits.

          OTL = 0b111 means the
         origination time is 7 hex digits (28 bits) long.

Is my math wrong or is your example wrong?

0b111 == 7. So (7 + 1) * 4 would be 32 bits.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Section 4:

   There are multiple ways that a packet can be delayed, including
   queuing delay, MAC layer contention delay, serialization delay, and
   propagation delays.  Sometimes there are processing delays as well.
   For the purpose of determining whether or not the deadline has
   already passed, these various delays are not distinguished.

Not distinguished from what? Do you mean "not counted"?

In Section 5:

   o  Binary Pt (6 bits) : If zero, the number of bits of the integer
      part the DT is equal to the number of bits of the fractional part
      of the DT.  if nonzero, the Binary Pt is a signed integer
      determining the position of the binary point within the value for
      the DT.

      *  If BinaryPt value is positive, then the number of bits for the
         integer part of the DT is increased by the value of BinaryPt,
         and the number of bits for the fractional part of the DT is
         correspondingly reduced.  This increases the range of DT.
      *  If BinaryPt value is negative, then the number of bits for the
         integer part of the DT is decreased by the value of BinaryPt,
         and the number of bits for the fractional part of the DT is
         correspondingly increased.  This increases the precision of the
         fractional seconds part of DT.

It would be good if you specified how negative values are represented (Ok,
maybe it is obvious) and the range for positive and negative values.

This fits right into my comment about the +1 inviting confusion.  What
you missed is that the +1 only applies to the DTL, not to the OTL:

> Ok, so 0b0000 ==> (0 + 1) * 4, means 4 bits.

Correct.

> 0b111 == 7. So (7 + 1) * 4 would be 32 bits.

No, for OTL it's 7*4 = 28.

I do think this is unnecessarily confusing, and don't see why there's
a need for the +1 on the DTL.  (Yes, I read Carsten's comment in
response, but I don't find it compelling.)

It means that they are all delays, and the cause of the delay doesn't
matter -- there's no distinction among the different delays.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the work everyone has put into this document. I have only a small
number of comments and some nits.

Comments:
- section 1, are the different timezones really a problem? I would assume that
all those devices are using a common reference such as UTC or does 'time zone'
in this document does not refer to EST, PST, CET, .. ? If so, then it should be
specified to ease the understanding - section 3, should explain why it starts
with 0b101, if there is no meaning but it is just an identifier for the option,
any reason why there is no IANA registry for this ? (and I understand that the
IANA registry should have been created in the master document) - section 3,
seems to imply that there is nothing after type but with a variable length.
Suggest to add 'options' - section 5, DTL is "unsigned 4-bit integer, encoding
the length of the field in hex digits" can you clarify whether it is the number
of 8-bit bytes or the number of 4-bit nibbles ? The rest of the text seems to
imply the latter but it would be nice to introduce it earlier IMHO. Also, if
odd number of nibbles, then the figure 3 is not really correct as it implies a
8-bit boundary. Or is there some padding ? Then it should be specified and
explained why simply not counting in 8-bit bytes. - more generally, I wonder
whether having a mechanism to prioritize 'soon to expire' packets would be
doable and benefitial. In the same vein, a description of the forwarding node
decision would be welcome rather then implied in the D flag description

Nit:
- abstract contains very long sentences which makes it hard to parse (esp the
last sentence) not to mention acronyms that should be expanded even if
well-known (M2M for example)

There is a serious problem with the last 5 paragraphs of section 8,
"Synchronization Aspects":  they seem to assume that the time
representation for the Deadline Time and Origination Time values will
wrap around, that is, that the representation is the absolute value
modulo the size of the field.  In addition, there is a lack of clarity
how the new epoch point will be chosen after the value wraps around.
This seems to contradict the earlier sections of the document which
speak of the values as if they are always to be considered as absolute
values on a time scale selected by the TU field, viz., either the NTP
time scale (in seconds) or the network's ASN numbering.

It's possible that four of these paragraphs are intended to only apply
to the use of TU = 00, the NTP time scale, and perhaps that usage of
the header is understood not to be completely specified yet.

However, the final paragraph discusses TU = 10 (the ASN time scale),
and claims that wrapping of the DT value is intended.  This is
relevant to current implementations.

Some sort of resolution of this is needed; as the document stands it
is self-inconsistent.  One possible resolution would be to omit these
paragraphs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCUSS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I support Magnus’s DISCUSS #1 (and perhaps we are noting the same thing)

The current Security Considerations text needs explicit discussion of the
impact of the deadline being manipulated.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) I also support Barry’s DISCUSS on the need to discuss what happens to a
network where all senders have short deadlines

(2) Section 5.  Per the description of the D flag, how would a forwarding
device “suspect that a downstream node might find [a packet] useful”?

(3) Section 6.  Is there normative language about the behavior of forwarding
entities when encountering the Deadline header in this section?  If not, I’d
recommend adding explicit text to that effect.

(4) Editorial nits:
** Section 4.  Typo.  s/the the/the/

Dear all:

During the review by Laurent, a question came up on whether the receiver co=
uld asynchronously send RFRAG Acks e.g., to transport an ECN indication.
At the moment, the sender is in full control and the ack is only sent if th=
e sender asks for it. Laurent indicates that asynchronous Ack could generat=
e more collisions and make the problem worse.

What do you all think?

Pascal

Dear all:

During the review by Laurent, a question came up on we could change the fra=
gment size when transmitting a datagram.
As it goes we can, because the offset and size are indicated in each fragme=
nt. If the MTU goes down and a fragment must be resend, we can also resend =
a smaller piece with the original fragment sequence and send other fragment=
s with unused sequences for the rest of the original fragment. This is made=
 possible because the sequence is sequential in the bitmap but not in the o=
rder of fragments.
That being said, a reaction to an ECN is to reduce the window. At the same =
time a node could also reduce the datagram size and enable a more streamlin=
ed transmission for all.

What do you all think?

Pascal

Dear all:

During the review by Laurent, a question came up on whether we could use pa=
ge 1 for fragments. At the moment the fragment is always before the 6lo rou=
ting header so there is no point. But say that we source route the fragment=
s end to end with a 6loRH, e.g., for projected DAO. Then supporting page 1 =
as well would save a page switch.

What do you all think?

Pascal

So would the ACKs be out of order, acknoledging fragment n+2 while still
waiting for fragment n?  Or would the acks be repeat of a previous ack (n-1),
indicating congestion, and likely signaling that fragment n got lost?

1) Not re-inventing TCP is important.
2) Perhaps the question is better turned around: what should the sender do if
   an ACK arrives without having been asked for?

This implies to me that we'd allocate code points for fragments from page 1.

What exactly does it mean to support page 1?
Duplicate code points?
Starting in page 1 mode for fragments?
Allocating all fragment code points from page 1?

Maybe we should have a document about source routing fragments end to end for
projected DAO, and then we can see the full picture.

An ack has the full bitmap of all that's received so far. That would be the=
 case there too. So it's a brand new ack, just unsolicited.
It is important for the sender to know all that's received to determine the=
 max number of fragments in flight.=20
So I agree that an unsolicited ack may be confusing, e.g. if the sender sen=
t it all and only asks for an ack in the end, then it may retry all that's =
en-route at the time the ack is emitted.
But then, it could find that the sequence for which is sent an ack request =
is not acknowledged so it would not take that action.=20

Yep. We're not there yet : )

Interesting, mostly in the light of your point above. I guess that it shoul=
d not infer that the packets sent after most recent acknowledged sequence a=
re lost; they may just be still in flight.=20
The sender retries the sequences in a round robin to leave a chance for the=
 next ack to ack packets en-route at the time the previous ack was issued.=
=20
It may reopen the window if the ack confirms reception of new packets, and =
tune the window size if ECN.=20
Since the packets are not sequenced, it might be that after a few tries, th=
e sender gets an ack that indicates that the receiver does not have the pac=
ket for which a retry was en-route at the time the ack was sent.=20
So I guess that there must be a round trip between each retransmission of a=
 packet. Unclear how to achieve that.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dear all:

I was rereading deadline and realized that the draft does not provide an um=
compressed form. What of the packet flies beyond the RPL domain? I think th=
e information should be useful there too.
Also we always claimed that RFC8138 is an encoding and that we can always t=
urn a packet to uncompressed and back. Deadline creates an exception to tha=
t rule, which changes RFC 8138 into a sub IP protocol as opposed to a compr=
ession.
All in all, I think that an IPv6 header (e.g., a new option in a hop-by-hop=
 header) should be provided, even if for now it appears to be for completen=
ess only.

What do others think?

Pascal

Hi Pascal,

=20

Thanks for your inputs.

=20

The draft specifies variable length deadline-time representation, only requ=
ired no. of bits to be carried and no compression methods are followed . Th=
e current revision is capable of carrying deadline time in ntp format also.=
=20

=20

We envisaged to use dispatch routing header for transporting deadline time.

=20

We agree your point that once the packet leaves the RPL network, then the d=
eadline information has to be carried in hop-by-hop header. In fact we ment=
ioned required text for calculating deadline time, while traversing  throug=
h different time zones.

=20

  Thanks & Regards,

  Lijo Thomas=20

Dear all

=20

The use case is when the data sync is not in the RPL domain or the packet h=
as to fly outside the RPL domain. E.g., A PLC virtualized in a MEC. The roo=
t needs to uncompress the packet and forward. The draft is missing the unco=
mpressed form.

=20

All the best,

Dear all:

I was rereading deadline and realized that the draft does not provide an um=
compressed form. What of the packet flies beyond the RPL domain? I think th=
e information should be useful there too.=20

=20

why useful? could you explain the use case?

=20

Also we always claimed that RFC8138 is an encoding and that we can always t=
urn a packet to uncompressed and back. Deadline creates an exception to tha=
t rule, which changes RFC 8138 into a sub IP protocol as opposed to a compr=
ession.

All in all, I think that an IPv6 header (e.g., a new option in a hop-by-hop=
 header) should be provided, even if for now it appears to be for completen=
ess only.

=20

What do others think?

=20

I need to know the use case.

Sorry to pick nits, but it's about whether the packet leaves an RPL network.
RPL runs across a multitude of layer-2s!
It's when it leaves an RFC8138 compressed LLN!

The difference in terminology leads to a difference in thinking.

To emphasize Pascal's point, and for many people who were not at the IETF
back in 2003, "subIP" was an entire area like Routing and Internet, which
addressed/created things like MPLS, ATM adaption layers, etc.   That's what
we are trying to avoid, because it has political and process issues.

I haven't read the deadline draft at this point, so I don't know if a new hop
by hop header makes sense, but it sounds right.

I think we should not change size to smaller when transmitting, but if
needed it must be limited for special cases.

Agreed that this vulnerability should be mentioned in the Security 
Considerations.

If other packet transmissions have to be pre-empted in order for the 
deadline to be met for a particular packet, then indeed this could 
affect other traffic.  It is also a matter of possible interest what 
might happen if there were two packets in the transmission queue with 
the same or different deadlines.  However, the processing in these cases 
is a local matter at each intermediate point, and out of scope for this 
draft.   Does this also belong to be mentioned in the Security 
Considerations?

This mechanism is a simple kind of signaling that could fit into various 
frameworks, and exploring that space would be pretty interesting.  But 
it would represent a huge digression away from the point of this draft, 
which all along was intended to offer a simple mechanisms without 
getting involved with messy issues of policy.  If there is something 
missing in the basic mechanism, then that should be fixed.  But I don't 
see what is missing.  Some of the discussion below is also relevant to 
this point.

This kind of signaling is far more appropriate at the application 
level.  To fully characterize the expected distribution of latency 
values is out of scope for the draft, and the information needed would 
usually depend on the application.  Some applications don't care much 
for dropped packets but don't want to handle packets coming in too 
late.  For other applications, knowing the distribution would allow for 
setting a deadline that would usually all reception of 85% of the 
packets (or some percentage predetermined by the application).  It's 
hard for me to see that as in scope for our draft.

As above, I think this is most properly handled by the application.

The policy details are out of scope for this draft.  However, it might 
be worthwhile to mention that (similar to many QoS efforts) care must be 
taken to avoid abuse.

We don't specify that, and since it's a local matter at each node, a 
mandate would be unenforceable.  However, if it is important, we could 
design an advisory extension to the draft for this purpose.  The problem 
is that the application should not necessarily need to be involved with 
changing its behavior in response to (highly dynamic) traffic conditions.

I think it would be best to enlarge the discussion in the draft to 
explain about the potential for abuse.  I don't see just how the simple 
mechanism at the level of 6LoRH should be charged with the 
responsibility for an entire framework, and I really hope that simple 
mechanisms such as this one can be found to have value even without 
specification of a much larger set of protections and repairs.

As mentioned in other email, I agree that we should discuss this 
problem, and I guess the right place would be in the Security 
Considerations.  I think the problem only occurs if pre-emption is 
allowed.  So one possibility would be to mandate that implementations 
SHOULD NOT pre-empt.

Designs for gaining some latency advantage by signaling often seem to 
have this problem.  Maybe there is already language we can borrow for 
clarifying the issue in our draft.

If pre-emption does not occur, then I don't think the network is 
impacted in the way that you suggest.  If every transmission specifies a 
short deadline time, then many or most packets will simply be dropped.

The reason is to allow 16 hex digits for the deadline time, or 64 bits.  
You are right that this makes implementation more vulnerable to error, 
but I believe the danger here is small.  If this is a minority opinion 
and most people want to have the maximum to be 15 hex digits, we can do 
that.

Charlie P.

Hello Carsten,

Thanks for pointing out that typo.  The expressions should have been 
"4..64-bit" in both cases.  It's amazing how often we can look at the 
text and still miss obvious mistakes.

Regards,
Charlie P.

That would help.  There's still the issue that an attacker (or just
inconsiderate use) could basically make this option useless (as you
note below) -- in such case it wouldn't actually be *worse* for the
network, but it would kill the benefits of asking for a short deadline
when you really need it.

The way we often deal with this is by defining options that allow
voluntary downgrading of service, but *not* elevation.  Clearly,
that's not what you're looking for here, but that works in many
situations.  You're right, of course, that allowing requests for
elevated service always prompts requests for elevated service.

> If pre-emption does not occur, then I don't think the network is

So, in the end, I don't know what more can be said about this other
than the "SHOULD NOT pre-empt" bit... and maybe a note that if this
gets gamed, its value will approach zero, and that's just the way it
is.

I don't feel strongly about this, and it's not at DISCUSS level, but
you can see from Alexey's question in his review, we already see
confusion.  And it's not so much that DTL starts at 0 for length one
(though it is that, somewhat) as it is that the two fields are
*different*: one starts at 0 and one starts at 1, and it seems like
the start of the rules for Fizzbin.  Clearly, because OTL needs to
represent 0, it needs to start as 1 =3D one.  So the question goes to
DTL: what range do you really expect to need?  Is it important enough
to get the extra 2x that it's worth adding the confusion?  If so, if
you really need the extra power of 2, then thanks for having the
discussion, and carry on.

But if it's just an issue that the extra power of 2 was possible, so
y'all did it "just in case", then please consider opting for a lower
chance of confusion.  Again, your judgment: I've made my comment, and
it's down to you now.

Thanks again for the response and for addressing my comments.
Barry

Hello Roman,

I agree with this.  Please also refer to my response to Magnus's 
observation and DISCUSS.

I also agree with this as noted in my response to Barry's observation 
and DISCUSS.  We will fashion appropriate text, and my guess is that it 
would go into the Security Considerations.  Do you think that is the 
right place?

I don't have the answer to that question.  I could imagine that 
intermediate devices are configured with traffic descriptors that cause 
a match to the "Forward_IF_D=0" behavior.  We could make a suggestion, 
but then avoid a normative condition for this behavior by specifying 
that the configuration details are out of scope for this document.  
Would that be O.K.?

This has been discussed in other emails as well.  It is possible to 
mandate that the Deadline header SHOULD NOT cause pre-emption. I think 
such mandates are not enforceable, but would anyway serve as guidance 
for implementation.
