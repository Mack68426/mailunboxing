Reviewer: Tim Chown
Review result: Almost Ready

Hi,

I have performed an early review of draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-11.

This draft updates and enhances the mechanisms defined in RFC6775 to support
IPv6 operation over low power networks (6LoWPAN ND).

Overall the draft is well-written and structured.

General comments:
--------------------------------------

The document could use a glossary of terms: LLN, 6LN, 6LBR, 6LR, BBR, etc.

The introduction could talk of other new added features, like avoiding DAD for
link locals.

The document includes RFC 7217 in the references, but doesn't include
discussion of it in the main body of the text.  Shouldn't RFC 7217 be
considered the norm here rather than address generation as per RFC 4862? 
Related, RFC 8064 "recommends against embedding stable link-layer addresses in
IPv6 Interface Identifiers".  The document is inconsistent - it talks of using
EUI64, then in Section 9 not using EUI64.

Specific comments:
--------------------------------------

p.3
Section 2, para 2 - should ND cache exhaustion attacks be included in the list
here?

p.4
Section 3 - Add RFC 7217 to RFC 4862?  It's recommended by RFC 8064.

p.6
Section 4 - for a node to prefer registering to a 6LR that supports the spec,
it would need to enumerate all available 6LRs; should the process for this be
described here, or is it included in sufficient detail in RFC 6775?

p.7
Section 4.1 - "not required to be a MAC address" - as per my general comment
above, with current IETF thinking, should this not be stronger, e.g. "SHOULD
NOT be a MAC address"?  Section 9 says this?

p.9
Section 4.2, point 4 - I find this quite para quite hard to read.

p.9
Section 4.3, para 1 - again, is using EUI-64 desirable?  Is the point to allow
header compression as per RFC4944?  Discuss the tradeoff? Section 4.3 para 2 -
so a different type of identifier could be an RFC 7217 generated identifier?

p.11
Section 4.6 - in the case of two 6LRs with the same link-layer addresses, does
it matter which a 6LN chooses?  Is the choice algorithmic? Section 4.6 - the
last para on p.11 seems to be repeated in the first para on p.12?

p.12
Section 4.6 - again, is the recommendation to use an (expected to be) unique LL
address in keeping with RFC 8064?

p.13
Para 4 - a Moved message SHOULD be used, yet elsewhere a node MUST clean up its
stale state?  Consistent? What about MIPv6-like spoofing security issues? You
say "an alternate protocol" - isn't this a little hand-wavy; shouldn't a single
mechanism be defined rather than multiple (undefined) mechanisms?

p.15
OUI is a confusing choice of term, given OUIs in MAC addresses; I guess this is
now baked into RFC 6775 though.

p.16
I don't think codes 5 and 10 are explained/defined in any detail here?  How is
the challenge made?

p.16
The registration lifetime is in minutes; why not in seconds?

p.18
Section 6.3 - SHOULD set the E flag; why not a MUST?  Why would you support the
spec, but not advertise that you do?  In contrast, on the next page in Section
7.1.1 you say nodes MUST set it.

p.19
Section 7.1.2 para 2 - would a LL address generally be used here as source? 
Should that be a SHOULD?  Using a temporary address is probably not ideal.

p.20
Section 7.3 para 4 - is this consistent with p.19 last para saying a 6LN MUST
use the updated spec once it knows it's supported? The last two paras here are
a bit vague/loose.

p.21
Section 8, para 3 - recommends using privacy techniques, but uses EUI64?

p.22
Limit the number of addresses?  What about RFC 7934?
The type of algorithm described here might be better defined generically for
6LoWPAN and 'real' IPv6?  I don't think anything has been defined for ND cache
exhaustion attack mitigation - would a separate draft be beneficial? I suspect
current solutions are vendor specific?

p.22
What trust model?

p.22
Section 9 - EUI64, or not EUI64?  Inconsistent.
Does anyone really use SeND?  Especially in 6LoWPAN networks?

p.24
Section 10.3 - statuses 5 and 10 are not detailed in the draft?

p.30
The multicast issues text could cite the new mboned draft on this topic.
"Plague" is maybe strong!

p.30
Appendix B - can we have a table showing WHICH requirements have been met by
the draft?

Nits:
--------------------------------------

p.4
Section 2 - "form and use multiple addresses" (add multiple)

p.4
Section 2 last para - "their" rather than "his"

p.6
"provides new" -> "provide new"

p.10
"route-over mesh" - add to definitions section

p.12
First line of last para needs rewriting - "If the registry in the 6LBR is be
saturated, in which case the LBR".

p.13
Could forward reference the summary of error codes in 6.1 or 10.3 here?

p.14
"removes silently" -> "silently removes"
"LLNs meshes" -> "LLN meshes"

p.15
Code 3; change tense to past tense, e.g. "fails" to "failed"

p.19
"capabilities" -> "capabilities is"
"such address" -> "such an address"
"in a" -> "in"
"6LB" -> "6LN" ?

p.21
"amlways" -> "always"
"to using" -> "using"
Missing close bracket for See Section 9.

p.30
Do you mean "sequence"?
"serves" -> "serves the"

p.31
"timely" -> "in a timely fashion" ?
B.1 last req - reword this.
The BIER Architecture is now an RFC I think?

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda based on the DRAFT AGENDA
for IETF101.  Remember that there is still quite some potential for
changes.

The painful ones (not necessarily fixable) this time include:
DINRG vs. ACE, CBOR vs. TEEP, ROLL vs. SUIT vs. OCF/WoT; also CORE
vs. ANIMA, CORE vs. QUIC.

All times are BST (UTC+0100).  (You can get pure UTC times on
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc, for those who want to
listen from remote.)

Reviewer: Tim Chown

Thanks a bunch Tim!

I answered with a prefix >=20

There are specific questions back to you down there. Please feel free to re=
move all Q/As for which we found an agreement already.



General comments:

The introduction could talk of other new added features, like avoiding DAD =
for link locals.

between the 6LN and the 6LR. One 6LR may accept to talk to a 6LN LN_A seen =
as LLA Addr_A and then later another 6LR may refuse that same Addr_A becaus=
e from its standpoint Addr_A duplicates a LLA used by another device that i=
s also talking to. The draft does not change what a LLA can be used for in =
route over, that is one radio hop; mostly, it reduces the illusion that a l=
ink local address can be DAD'ed in a network that is not fully and permanen=
tly connected.=20

Specific comments:
--------------------------------------

p.3
Section 2, para 2 - should ND cache exhaustion attacks be included in the l=
ist here?

> If the method is used as a full replacement of reactive ND, then there ca=
n be some control. e.g. we'd be immune from NCE DOS attack from a remote pa=
rty. But it's a touchy space. In the one hand, we never block from using bo=
th, IOW classical (reactive) ND in conjunction with the new (proactive) reg=
istration. Also a local node could still attack the cache by performing ton=
s of registrations, forging MAC addresses as it goes if need be.  It will t=
ake separate work to address all the security requirements (AP-ND https://t=
ools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-ap-nd and more).



**********************



p.4
Section 3 - Add RFC 7217 to RFC 4862?  It's recommended by RFC 8064.

> This is a terminology section. Are there terms we need from RFC 7217? Not=
e that this specification does not dictate how to form address, just manage=
s them. Still it places recommendation to the protocol developers coming ne=
xt (e.g. for a particular link layer) to consider privacy. Text related to =
RFC 7217 is added in section 9 per your other comment.



**********************



p.6
Section 4 - for a node to prefer registering to a 6LR that supports the spe=
c, it would need to enumerate all available 6LRs; should the process for th=
is be described here, or is it included in sufficient detail in RFC 6775?

> You are correct. There is no enumeration process; 6LRs are discovered as =
described in RFC 6775 sections 5.2 and 5.3. by sending out mcast RS. This d=
ocument updates RFC 6775 but we avoided paraphrasing it as much as we could=
, considering that this doc is already quite thick.=20
Still I added the first line of the text below:
"
    <t> Section 5 of <xref target=3D"RFC6775"/> specifies how a 6LN bootstr=
aps an
    interface and locates available 6LRs; a Registering Node SHOULD prefer
	registering to a 6LR that is found to support this specification, as
	discussed in <xref target=3D"dsc"/>, over a legacy one.
    </t>
"


**********************



   =20
p.7
Section 4.1 - "not required to be a MAC address" - as per my general commen=
t above, with current IETF thinking, should this not be stronger, e.g. "SHO=
ULD NOT be a MAC address"?  Section 9 says this?

> I see where you're coming from and htat makes sense to me. But the WG nev=
er went that far. Note that this is not a subfield in an address; as it goe=
s the message is not not supposed to leak outside. RFC 6775 forced the UID =
to be a MAC address in the EUI-64 form. This specification does not depreca=
te the legacy behavior and it allows for something else.  But it recommends=
 (section 8) to use a privacy technique such as AP-ND instead. Once AP-ND i=
s standard, we can deprecate the legacy behavior if the WG finds it relevan=
t, e.g. when we apply it to networks that are more sensitive to privacy.




**********************




p.9
Section 4.2, point 4 - I find this quite para quite hard to read.

> Agreed, it is inlined from RFC 6550 as opposed to referenced per WG and s=
hepherd decision. I simplified to:
"	=09
		If two sequence numbers are determined to be not comparable,
		i.e. the results of the comparison are not defined, then a node
		should give precedence to the sequence number that was most recently
        incremented. Failing this, the node should select the sequence numb=
er=20
        in order to minimize the resulting changes to its own state.

"



**********************



p.9
Section 4.3, para 1 - again, is using EUI-64 desirable?  Is the point to al=
low header compression as per RFC4944?  Discuss the tradeoff? Section 4.3 p=
ara 2 - so a different type of identifier could be an RFC 7217 generated id=
entifier?

> It could be many things but collisions should be avoided. It should not b=
e an interface ID since this is to complement the DAD of the IID. AP-ND bui=
lds it on cryptography. Your point is excellent, unsure if this doc should =
be the vessel for it. At this stage, we never argued deprecation before, ju=
st extension. It will take WG work to define possible replacements and this=
 doc may be too advanced for that I guess, but I'll ask.




**********************



p.11
Section 4.6 - in the case of two 6LRs with the same link-layer addresses, d=
oes it matter which a 6LN chooses?  Is the choice algorithmic? Section 4.6 =
- the last para on p.11 seems to be repeated in the first para on p.12?

> This specification (including RFC 6775) does not have a router preference=
 (whether they have a same or different LLA) beyond RFC 4191. RPL does, bas=
ed on Rank and the upcoming enrollment specification will also hint on that=
. And apparently yes to your other point, cleaning up.



**********************



p.12
Section 4.6 - again, is the recommendation to use an (expected to be) uniqu=
e LL address in keeping with RFC 8064?

> There is a chicken and an egg problem with the first registration of the =
first LLA. It is better that it does not fail. RFC6775 stipulates that MAC-=
derived LLA do not need DAD. This message flies over one hop, between a nod=
e and its nearby router. The node may then form as many privacy LL and GUA =
as it likes.=20



**********************



p.13
Para 4 - a Moved message SHOULD be used, yet elsewhere a node MUST clean up=
 its stale state?  Consistent? What about MIPv6-like spoofing security issu=
es? You say "an alternate protocol" - isn't this a little hand-wavy; should=
n't a single mechanism be defined rather than multiple (undefined) mechanis=
ms?

> Agreed. That single mechanism is DAR/DAC. I removed the "an alternate pro=
tocol"; what was meant is now separately drafted in draft-thubert-roll-unaw=
are-leaves. This is where using RPL to proxy the registration is described.=
 Unsure about which MIP attack you have in mind?



**********************




p.15
OUI is a confusing choice of term, given OUIs in MAC addresses; I guess thi=
s is now baked into RFC 6775 though.

> Actually no. RFC 6775 uses EUI-64 throughout. We picked that term to gene=
ralize the EUI-64, so I guess we can still change that name. I changed it t=
o Registration Unique ID (RUID) but that does not sound so right; would you=
 have suggestions?
> I'll take that question to the WG separately.


**********************



p.16
I don't think codes 5 and 10 are explained/defined in any detail here?  How=
 is the challenge made?

> This is used in a freference spec. I clarified that by adding 3 lines at =
the end of the text in the RUID (ex OUID) section which now reads:

"	The Registration Unique ID in <xref target=3D"RFC6775"/>
	is a EUI-64 globally unique address configured at a Lower Layer,
	under the assumption that duplicate EUI-64 addresses are avoided.
	With this specification, the Registration Unique ID is allowed to be
    extended to different types of identifier, as long as the type is clear=
ly
	indicated. For instance, the type can be a cryptographic string and
	used to prove the ownership of the registration as discussed in
	<xref target=3D"I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd">
	"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks"
	</xref>. In order to support the flows related to the proof of ownership,
    this specification introduces new status codes "Validation Requested" a=
nd
    "Validation Failed" in the EARO.=20

"


**********************



p.16
The registration lifetime is in minutes; why not in seconds?

> RFC 6775 is missing a way to express the time unit (RPL has one).=20
We used minutes because a typical LLN operates at a very slow pace, and a t=
ypical device is like a three-toed sloth that would sleep more than a cat. =
We even had a requirement to produce an 'infinite' lifetime for the likes o=
f light bulbs but never took it that slow. We could change the format but t=
hat would not be backward compatible.
> I'll take that question to the WG separately=20



**********************



p.18
Section 6.3 - SHOULD set the E flag; why not a MUST?  Why would you support=
 the spec, but not advertise that you do?  In contrast, on the next page in=
 Section
7.1.1 you say nodes MUST set it.

> fixed, it was a MUST :)

**********************



p.19
Section 7.1.2 para 2 - would a LL address generally be used here as source?=
=20
Should that be a SHOULD?  Using a temporary address is probably not ideal.

> RFC 6775 used the registered address (LL or GUA) as source and the target=
 was not really important. With this specification, register the target of =
the NS, and there is no point remembering the source address of the registr=
ation NS after the NA was sent back. A 6LR can talk to the registered addre=
ss using the registered address.


**********************



p.20
Section 7.3 para 4 - is this consistent with p.19 last para saying a 6LN MU=
ST use the updated spec once it knows it's supported? The last two paras he=
re are a bit vague/loose.

> I turned the text into:

"	    After detecting a legacy 6LR, an updated 6LN SHOULD attempt to find a=
n
	    alternate 6LR that is updated for a reasonable time that depends on th=
e
        type of device and the expected deployment.
"

**********************



p.21
Section 8, para 3 - recommends using privacy techniques, but uses EUI64?

> RFC 6775 uses EUI. AP-ND uses a cryptographically generated token instead=
. This section effectively recommends AP-ND or whatever else cmes next that=
 has privacy concerns.


**********************



p.22
Limit the number of addresses?  What about RFC 7934?
The type of algorithm described here might be better defined generically fo=
r 6LoWPAN and 'real' IPv6?  I don't think anything has been defined for ND =
cache exhaustion attack mitigation - would a separate draft be beneficial? =
I suspect current solutions are vendor specific?

> We applied wisdom from RFC9734 and removed text that indicated that an ad=
ministrator could be on the path of accepting an address or not. I know for=
 having coded it that yes, (at least some) vendors provide a protection in =
the number of addresses that can be registered or snooped from a given devi=
ce wen there is a limit for the overall resources to serve the network. A c=
lassical NCE is a cache but a 6LR NCE is really a hard state that the regis=
trar guarantees to maintain for a given lifetime. The fact that a protectio=
n can be configured does not force a user in a particular deployment  to us=
e that protection. I agree that there is a need for NCE attack mitigation f=
or both classical ND and 6LoWPAN ND. But till that spec exists, we cannot f=
orce the 6LR device to drop all protection against a misbehaving 6LN. A 6LR=
 is an IOT device and it might easily be pushed beyond capacity.=20



**********************



p.22
What trust model?

> Should I add words? Those networks are always protected at Layer 2. But r=
eally, we'd like to see a draft that enables a 6LBR to prove it has that ca=
pacity and is entitled to play the role for the network. This is beyond the=
 scope of this particular draft and should be done in a security related 6L=
oWPAN draft.


**********************



p.22
Section 9 - EUI64, or not EUI64?  Inconsistent.
Does anyone really use SeND?  Especially in 6LoWPAN networks?

> There are 2 uses of EUI that must be differentiated. The OUID (now RUID) =
is a unique ID for the device to correlate registrations for DAD between ho=
nest people. This section ere talks about IID in the IPv6 address. The text=
 explains that no, SEND cannot be used in that space. This is why we do AP-=
ND instead. With AP-ND, the OUID is used to prove cryptographically the own=
ership of the registered address a bit like CGA does, but it is not part of=
 the address. It is stored upon the first registration f an address and use=
d later to validate that the new registration comes from the same guy.

Reviewer: Tim Chown
Review result: Almost Ready

Hi,

I have performed an early review of draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-11.

This draft updates and enhances the mechanisms defined in RFC6775 to suppor=
t
IPv6 operation over low power networks (6LoWPAN ND).

Overall the draft is well-written and structured.

General comments:
--------------------------------------

The document could use a glossary of terms: LLN, 6LN, 6LBR, 6LR, BBR, etc.

The introduction could talk of other new added features, like avoiding DAD =
for
link locals.

The document includes RFC 7217 in the references, but doesn't include
discussion of it in the main body of the text.  Shouldn't RFC 7217 be
considered the norm here rather than address generation as per RFC 4862?=20
Related, RFC 8064 "recommends against embedding stable link-layer addresses=
 in
IPv6 Interface Identifiers".  The document is inconsistent - it talks of us=
ing
EUI64, then in Section 9 not using EUI64.

ypical device is like a three-toed sloth that would sleep more than a cat. =
We even had a requirement to produce an 'infinite' lifetime for the likes o=
f light bulbs but never took it that slow. We could change the format but t=
hat would not be backward compatible.
"

For memory, RPL advertises the lifetime unit in the configuration option, a=
nd the resulting lifetime can be sent in one octet in DAO.=20
We could encode lifetime differently here as well, like splitting the 2 oct=
ets, but that would break backward compatibility.

Any idea?

Dear all

As part of his review Tim asked "
Section 4.3, para 1 - again, is using EUI-64 desirable?
"

Effectively using a EUI 64 as a device ID in the registration has privacy i=
mplications, though limited to the subnet.
AP-ND replaces it with a crypto token that has better privacy properties. S=
hould we at some point deprecate EUI 64?

The IESG has received a request from the IPv6 over Networks of
Resource-constrained Nodes WG (6lo) to consider the following document: - 'An
Update to 6LoWPAN ND'
  <draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-11.txt> as Proposed Standard

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits final
comments on this action. Please send substantive comments to the
ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by 2018-03-06. Exceptionally, comments may be
sent to iesg@ietf.org instead. In either case, please retain the beginning of
the Subject line to allow automated sorting.

Abstract


   This specification updates RFC 6775 - 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery, to
   clarify the role of the protocol as a registration technique,
   simplify the registration operation in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to
   provide enhancements to the registration capabilities and mobility
   detection for different network topologies including the backbone
   routers performing proxy Neighbor Discovery in a low power network.

Abstract:
   This specification updates RFC 6775 - 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery, to
   clarify the role of the protocol as a registration technique,
   simplify the registration operation in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to
   provide enhancements to the registration capabilities and mobility
   detection for different network topologies including the backbone
   routers performing proxy Neighbor Discovery in a low power network.

Hello folks,

In preparation for another revision of our document, we have revisited 
the discussion at IETF 99.  A few of the comments needed more 
discussion, which after discussion can be resolved in the upcoming revision.

> * Kerry Lynn: back to Pascal's question. Not all hops have same "cost" 
> (transit time). Where is time spent? propagation, queuing, ...? 

There are indeed multiple ways that a packet can be delayed, including 
propagation delay and queuing delays.  Sometimes there are processing 
delays as well.  For the purpose of determining whether or not the 
deadline has already passed, these various delays are not 
distinguished.  Maybe a sentence should be added to the draft that 
mentions some of the kinds of delay as just identified.

> * Samita: About time synch mechanism/protocol, any recommendation?

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-detnet-problem-statement-02

contains the following:

“Time synchronization techniques need not be addressed by an IETF
    Working Group; there are a number of standards available for this
    purpose, including IEEE 1588, IEEE 802.1AS, and more.”

I think we can use the same wording, and add the same reference to our 
draft.


> * Gabriel: if D bit set, text says SHOULD drop. Anything bad can 
> happen if implementation does not obey SHOULD? Then maybe turn it into 
> MUST
> * Thomas: Recommend to put MUST.
> * Pascal: This header is optional to process.

All in all, I think that the consensus is to change to "MUST drop".  But:

> * Pascal: application cannot rely that packet will *not* be delivered 
> after deadline. Only use it as "discard preferably to other packets" 
> after deadline.

I also agree with the first sentence.  But, after the deadline I think 
the packet needs to be dropped if only for the purposes of saving 
interference over the air and processing time at the receiver.

Regards,
Charlie P.

    <p>I also agree with the first sentence.  But, after the deadline I
      think the packet needs to be dropped if only for the purposes of
      saving interference over the air and processing time at the
      receiver.<br>

Reviewer: Jürgen Schönwälder
Review result: Has Issues

As an outsider, I would also have preferred to see the message formats
before reading the details how protocol entities have to use the
message fields and react to messages received. But this may be
personal preference. Overall, I found the text to be clear, except
where noted below.

>From an operational point of view, I wonder whether there is work
planned to enable the network administrator to monitor registrations
and to identify routers that run out of registration capacity or to
detect high numbers of failing registrations (which could have
technical reasons but could also be caused by malicious activity).
The text says network administrators should make sure there is
sufficient registration capacity but without any way to monitor usage
of registration capacity, this may be difficult to achieve in
environments where the network administrator has not control over
devices getting deployed.

Section 2:

- What is the 'legacy 6LoWPAN ND specification'? I found out later
  that legacy is a defined term in Section 3. Perhaps it makes sense
  to first define the terminology, i.e., swapping sections 2 and 3.

- 'With this specification, a failed or useless registration can be
  detected...' - detected by whom? The entity registering or the
  entity managing the registrations?

- There is advice that network administrators should deploy 6LR/6LBRs
  matching the number and type of devices. Since it is usually
  difficult to know how many registrations a network will require, is
  there a way to find out when the 6LR/6LBRs run out of capacity or is
  there a way to monitor the usage of the registration capacity?

Section 3:

- The phrase 'to be a higher speed device speed' is odd; note that you
  are actually talking about a link and its datarate.

Section 4:

- Note sure I understand the sentence that includes 'is be
  saturated'. I guess you mean:

   If the registry in the 6LBR is saturated, then the LBR
   cannot decide whether a new address is a duplicate.

  But perhaps I have not understood the situation really. I understand
  that once saturated, registration requests are denied. Perhaps all
  you wanted to say is this:

   If the registry in the 6LBR is saturated, then the LBR
   replies to a EDAR message with a EDAC message
   that carries a Status code 9 indicating "6LBR Registry saturated",

Section 5:

- s/is a used as a/is used as a/

Section 7:

- Is there a verb missing in the first sentence of 7.1.2?

- s/in a registration flows/in a registration flow/

Section 8:

- RFC 6775 is not really a 'draft'

- s/requesting a node the/requesting node the/

- I wonder to what extend the expectation that the underlying network
  provides secure unicast and multicast services and that there is a
  trust model in place that ensures that only the right devices act as
  6LBR and 6BBR is wishful thinking. Should the document more clearly
  spell out how fragile things will be if this is not the case? Should
  the document provide concrete pointers how to satisfy these
  requirements? I know, this is a nasty question but deploying this
  technology without proper protection sounds like a real problem.
  Anyway, this is probably for the secdir reviewers to think about.

Section 9:

- s/section Section/Section/

- Should there be any discussion of the possibility to monitor
  movements? Should a device actually claim a different identity when
  moving?

  noun (plural legacies)=20
    an amount of money or property left to someone in a will.=20
    =E2=80=A2 a thing handed down by a predecessor: the legacy of =

superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use.=20


The marketing term =E2=80=9Clegacy=E2=80=9D is used a lot by people who =
want to sell you their newest snake oil.

If you find =E2=80=9Clegacy=E2=80=9D in a technical document outside the =
above narrow technical sense, this generally raises warning flags in =
people that have been around for a while.

Since the updated 6LoWPAN-ND is not snake oil, we should avoid sending =
this signal of non-competence.

(It appears here this is just about =E2=80=9Cprevious version of the =
present specification=E2=80=9D.)

Dear all :

ROLL has the concept of a leaf, that is a 6LN that is not aware of RPL but =
needs routing handled for it.

With RPL, and probably any other route-over protocol, there is a need to si=
gnal either way, i.e. the node handles its routing (like a classical RPL no=
de) or the node expects that the 6LR will manage the routing on its behalf =
(like a RPL leaf). The bit is IGP-agnostic, and it applies to any protocol.

draft-thubert-roll-unaware-leaves suggests a bit that indicates that the 6L=
R that is capable to handle its routing should signal it, so the unaware le=
af does not need to set it.

Q: Should the bit be defined in rfc6775-update as opposed to a ROLL since i=
t is IGP agnostic?

Side question: Is it the right approach or should the leaf set the bit inst=
ead?

Cheers,

Pascal

Pascal,

I would look at the text where 'legacy' is used and decide in each
context whether this term can be avoided. I assume with a bit of text
tweaking, the term can be avoided. But my issue was not the term
itself but that it appeared in section 2 before it was defined in
section 3 (which could perhaps be resolved by swapping sections 2 and
3).

Abstract:
   This specification updates RFC 6775 - 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery, to
   clarify the role of the protocol as a registration technique,
   simplify the registration operation in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to
   provide enhancements to the registration capabilities and mobility
   detection for different network topologies including the backbone
   routers performing proxy Neighbor Discovery in a low power network.

This *is* a new change to existing devices.

I think it depends upon whether the leaf is a legacy device.

We can't just plug a Windows7 PC into an arbitrary 802.15.4 network, because
there generally aren't drivers.  So there really isn't a legacy question.

We almost always are creating new code, in which case we can create code
which sets a bit which says, "Please manage my routing for me".
This is not a burden, because such leaf devices do not really exist yet.

Hello Michael

I understand that  you suggest to reverse the bit from my draft, so that it=
 is set by a leaf that does not support its own routing.
I agree that this minimizes the changes to the existing. But also this mean=
s that I should change RFC6775-update to specify that.

I'm happy with that approach and will do it if the WG does not disagree. Wh=
at do others think?

Pascal

Dear all,

KEREVAL is a french testing lab involved in the European project F-interop =
which aim is to develop an interoperability testing platform for WPAN.
In this project, we develop the 6lo interoperability testing part.

For the next IETF-101, during the hackaton slot, we'll organize a plugtest =
in order for 6lo providers to test the interoperability of their solutions.
We cover the following RFCs:
- RFC4944: Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks
- RFC6282: Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4-Based N=
etworks
- RFC6775: Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless=
 Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)
We'll come with an implementation based on linux-WPAN running on a RPi and =
the radio chip.

You'll find, in few days, materials describing the platform and how to use =
it, in the Hackaton website.

If you are interested, here is a doodle, in order for us to know if you cou=
ld have interest for this plugtest and to organize it.
https://doodle.com/poll/z4bcptmtqdpbbker=20
(please, could you use the comment part of the doodle to indicate which you=
r name implementation is)

Thanks for your attention.

Regards=20

This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks
        Authors         : Pascal Thubert

Abstract:
   This document defines an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   [RFC6775][I-D.ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update] called Address Protected ND
   (AP-ND); AP-ND protects the owner of an address against address theft
   and impersonation inside a low-power and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes
   supporting this extension compute a cryptographic Owner Unique
   Interface ID and associate it with one or more of their Registered
   Addresses.  The Cryptographic ID uniquely identifies the owner of the
   Registered Address and can be used for proof-of-ownership.  It is
   used in 6LoWPAN ND in place of the EUI-64-based unique ID that is
   associated with the registration.  Once an address is registered with
   a Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify the anchor
   state information of the Registered Address, and Source Address
   Validation can be enforced.

        Title           : IPv6 Backbone Router
        Author          : Pascal Thubert
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-backbone-router-06.txt
	Pages           : 29
	Date            : 2018-02-23

Abstract:
   This specification proposes proxy operations for IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery on behalf of devices located on broadcast-inefficient
   wireless networks.  A broadcast-efficient backbone running classical
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery federates multiple wireless links to form a
   large MultiLink Subnet, but the broadcast domain does not need to
   extend to the wireless links for the purpose of ND operation.
   Backbone Routers placed at the wireless edge of the backbone proxy
   the ND operation and route packets from/to registered nodes, and
   wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered to the Backbone
   Router to setup proxy services in a fashion that is essentially
   similar to a classical Layer-2 association.

Abstract:
   This specification updates RFC 6775 - 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery, to
   clarify the role of the protocol as a registration technique,
   simplify the registration operation in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to
   provide enhancements to the registration capabilities and mobility
   detection for different network topologies including the backbone
   routers performing proxy Neighbor Discovery in a low power network.

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda based on the "FINAL" AGENDA
for IETF101.  Remember that "FINAL" means this will be the basis for
printed agenda sheets, there is still some potential for changes after
that.

SUIT is now on top of CORE (!??).

(Also, ICE has moved.)  The painful ones this time include: DINRG
vs. ACE, CBOR vs. TEEP, ROLL vs. traveling to OCF/WoT; also CORE
vs. ANIMA, CORE vs. QUIC, CORE vs. SECDISPATCH.

All times are actually in GMT (UTC+0000, DST only starts in London on
March 25).  (You can always get pure UTC times on
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc, for those who want to
listen from remote.)

Hello, 

I have been selected as the Routing Directorate reviewer for this draft. The
Routing Directorate seeks to review all routing or routing-related drafts as
they pass through IETF last call and IESG review, and sometimes on special
request. The purpose of the review is to provide assistance to the Routing ADs.
For more information about the Routing Directorate, please see
http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/rtg/trac/wiki/RtgDir 

Although these comments are primarily for the use of the Routing ADs, it would
be helpful if you could consider them along with any other IETF Last Call
comments that you receive, and strive to resolve them through discussion or by
updating the draft. 

Document: draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-13.txt
Note: I reviewed -13 (-14 came out half way through my review, but I kept right
on anyway).
Reviewer: Adrian Farrel
Review Date: 24th Feb 2018
IETF LC End Date: 6th Mar 2018
Intended Status: Standards Track 

Summary: 

I have concerns about this document and recommend that the Routing ADs discuss
these issues further with the authors. 
I also a long list of minor concerns and nits that I think should be resolved
before publication. 

Comments: 

The document is quite hard work. More cross-references would help, and bringing
the abbreviations to the top would also make things easier. But the main problem
was the trickle feed of how everything hangs together - it's all there, but you
have to read the entire document to get the whole picture.

==Major==

4.3

   With this specification, the Registration Unique ID is allowed to be
   extended to different types of identifier, as long as the type is
   clearly indicated.  For instance, the type can be a cryptographic
   string and used to prove the ownership of the registration as
   discussed in "Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and
   Lossy Networks" [I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd].  In order to support the flows
   related to the proof of ownership, this specification introduces new
   status codes "Validation Requested" and "Validation Failed" in the
   EARO.

This seems fine, but I don't see how "the type is clearly indicated".

I think you also have to restate the uniqueness assumption in this new
context. Probably that uniqueness is required across {type, value}
(unless, of course, your answer to my first question is that type is 
embedded in value).  This possibly cuts into backward compatibility as
well?

See also 6.1/6.2

Furthermore, 7.1.2 says...

   A node that supports this specification MUST always use an EARO as a
   replacement to an ARO in its registration to a router.  This is
   harmless since the "T" flag and TID field are reserved in [RFC6775],
   and are ignored by a RFC6775-only router.  A router that supports
   this specification answers an ARO with an ARO and answers an EARO
   with an EARO.

...but this doesn't mention the "variation" of the RUID that might also
arise with the EARO. How will the RFC6775-only router handle these new
RUIDs and their "clearly indicated" types?

---

7.1.2

   One alternate way for a 6LN to discover the router's capabilities is
   to start by registering...

You went to a lot of trouble to define the E-flag. You then made the use
of the 6CIO (and hence the E-flag) only a SHOULD, and you defined an
alternate mechanism. (Note: you say "one alternate" implying there are
more!)

Choice is not good. It complicates the specification and the 
implementation. Why go there? Can't you settle on one mechanism and 
make it necessary and sufficient?

---

You create new registries in 10.1 and 10.2. You must tell the IANA what
allocation policies to use


==Minor==       

You have a number of cases of "SHOULD" and "RECOMMENDED" without
corresponding "MAY" clauses to describe variations. I think that I
could deduce the reasons (implementation decided to not do it) and
the results (function is not as rich), but you really should spell
these things out.

---

Would you consider folding Appendix C into the top of Section 2 so 
that it is possible to find the expansion of abbreviations more
easily?

---

RFC 6775 updates RFC 4944. Does this document also update RFC 4944?

---

I missed a discussion of Manageability and especially diagnosing faults.
It's not mandatory, but it would have been good. (There is a trickle of
info about policy configuration in 7.3).

---

The 2119 boilerplate should be updated to the most recent, viz.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

...which will require you add 8174 as a reference

---

Sect 2 expects the reader to be familiar with terms and concepts in a
long list of other documents. Doesn't that make them normative refs?

[RFC7102]
[RFC7228]
[RFC4861]
[RFC4862]
[RFC6606]
[RFC4919]
[RFC6775]
[I-D.ietf-ipv6-multilink-subnets]

---

Sect 2 has

   Extended LLN:  The aggregation of multiple LLNs as defined in
         [RFC4919], interconnected by a Backbone Link via Backbone
         Routers, and forming a single IPv6 MultiLink Subnet.

I'm not super-familiar with 4919, but a quick scan did not make it
obvious what you are referencing in that document.  "LLN" is not
mentioned. Nor is "aggregation" or "interconnect" (in this context).
There is some mention in 4.2 of "seamless integration": is that what
you are referencing?

---

Sect 2 has

   Registration:  The process during which a 6LN registers its
         address(es) with the Border Router so the 6BBR can serve as
         proxy for ND operations over the Backbone.

Do you mean s/Border/Backbone/ ?
Otherwise it seems strange that the 6LN registers with the 6LBR so that
the 6BBR can do something.

---

Sect 2

   Binding:  The association between an IP address with a MAC address, a
         port and/or other information about the node that owns the IP
         address.

This was hard to parse. Possibly you mean...

   Binding:  The association between an IP address, a MAC address, a
         port, and other information about the node that owns the IP
         address.

---

Sect 2

   Registering Node:  The node that performs the registration to the
         6BBR, which may proxy for the registered node.

Confusing!
The 6BBR is defined as the "proxy for the registration".
Now we appear to have:
- a node that needs to be registered
- a node that does the registration to the 6BBR
- the 6BBR (the proxy)
The final subclause of your text ("which may proxy for the registered
node") could be applied to the node that performs the registration or
to the 6BBR.

---

4.1

   The Extended ARO (EARO) deprecates the ARO and is backward compatible
   with it.  More details on backward compatibility can be found in
   Section 7.

   The semantics of the ARO are modified as follows:

Given the "deprecates" statement, you probably want...

   The semantics of the EARO are identical to the ARO with the following
   modifications:

---

4.2

   The Transaction ID (TID) is a sequence number that is incremented
   with each re-registration.

Who increments?

---

4.2

   The TID may also be used by the
   network to track the sequence of movements of a node in order to
   route to the current (freshest known) location of a moving node.

You don't need to track the sequence of movements in order to identify
the freshest known location. You only have to spot the most recent TID.
This makes a big difference to implementations: is there a need to track
the sequence or can an implementation just look for the most recent TID?

---

4.7

   If the registry in the 6LBR is saturated, then the LBR cannot decide
   whether a new address is a duplicate.  In that case, the 6LBR replies
   to a EDAR message with a EDAC message that carries a new Status Code
   indicating "6LBR Registry saturated" Table 1.  Note: this code is
   used by 6LBRs instead of Status 2 when responding to a Duplicate
   Address message exchange and passed on to the Registering Node by the
   6LR.  There is no point for the node to retry this registration
   immediately via another 6LR, since the problem is global to the
   network.  The node may either abandon that address, de-register other
   addresses first to make room, or keep the address in TENTATIVE state
   and retry later.

Three points:

"cannot" seems strong since the first occurrence of the duplicate might
already be in the registry.

de-registering an address to make room seems a risky business since some
other 6LR might grab the space.

Shouldn't the actions be at the 6LBR
- to notify the operator
- to clear out "old" entries from the registry (although that may require
  magic beyond housekeeping after Registration Lifetime expiration: 
  perhaps it could curtail the Delay state?)

---

5.

   The 6CIO is typically sent in a Router Solicitation (RS) message.
   When used to signal capabilities per this specification, the 6CIO is
   typically present in Router Advertisement (RA) messages but can also
   be present in RS, Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) messages.

I didn't find the two uses of "typically" gave me confidence to know
what to code.

---

6.1

   |   3   | Moved: The registration failed because it is not the      |
   |       | freshest.  This Status indicates that the registration is |
   |       | rejected because another more recent registration was     |
   |       | done, as indicated by a same RUID and a more recent TID.  |
   |       | One possible cause is a stale registration that has       |
   |       | progressed slowly in the network and was passed by a more |
   |       | recent one.  It could also indicate a RUID collision.     |

Do you think "Moved" is the best name to cover all of these 
possibilities?

But, anyway, how can you have a RUID collision by definition of a RUID?

---

6.1

                   The node SHOULD maintain the TID in a persistent
                   storage.

Unfortunate to push persistent storage requirements. But, since this is
a SHOULD, all processes are in place to support not storing across 
restarts. So why make anyone do it? Surely you could fall back to the
default handling without persistent storage.

---

6.2 

   Code:           The ICMP Code as defined in [RFC4443].  The ICMP Code
                   MUST be set to 1 with this specification.  An odd
                   value of the ICMP Code indicates that the TID field  
                   is present and obeys this specification.             

You're overloading the ICMP Code in an ugly way. But you knew that :-)
It would probably be more normal to steal the top bit so that allocation
of new codes can continue more normally. But failing that, I think you 
would be wise to make it so the IANA registry clearly shows that the odd
values must not be assigned in future (section 10.2).

---

It is not clear whether anything in App A and B is intended to be normative.
A clear statement would be helpful.

==Nits==

idnits shows three problems

 ** There is 1 instance of too long lines in the document, the longest one
     being 3 characters in excess of 72.

  == Missing Reference: 'Perlman83' is mentioned on line 1392, but not defined

  == Missing Reference: 'IEEEstd802154' is mentioned on line 1615, but not
     defined

The references are caused by you having a third references section. I've not
seen that before. Why not merge the sections as normal?

---

Document header

I suspect "cisco" should have a capital "C"

---

I think the document title should spell out "Neighbor Discovery" and
"IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks"

---

Sect 1

s/an IPv6 Low Power Networks/any IPv6 Low Power Network/

---

Sect 1

   to enable additional capabilities and enhancements such as:

s/such as/including/

---

You use "NS" in section 4, but don't expand it until 4.1

---

4.4 could very usefully point at 6.2 to help the reader parse the text.

---

Shouldn't the figure in 6.2 show the optional ND options as described in
4.4?

---

4.7 has "LBR" which should be "6LBR"

---

6.1

s/SLLAO option/SLLA option/ (twice)
s/The EARO option/The EARO/  (three times)

---

6.3

   This specification defines new capability bits for use in the 6CIO,
   which was introduced by [RFC7400] for use in IPv6 ND RA messages.

Say "...defines four new..." to save me having to work out which bits
are new.

---

6.3
   Routers that support this specification MUST set the "E" flag and 6LN
   SHOULD favor 6LR routers that support this specification over those
   that do not. 

s/6LR routers that support/a 6LR that supports/ 

---

8.

   This specification extends [RFC6775], and the security section of
   that standard also applies to this as well.

Don't think 6775 is an Internet Standard.
Suggest s/standard/document/.

I don't understand how a node, 6LN, that is not aware of RPL can 
nevertheless set a bit related to RPL.
I expect the 6LR to do all handling.

Or do I misunderstand the context?

HI Pascal,

the bit definition sounds like a 6LO subject.
Handling the bit for RPL like a Roll subject.

makes sense? (did I understand correctly?)

This terminology is confusing.

In RPL, a Leaf Node is a RPL router that does not forward (RFC 6550 =
Section 8.5).

We also have hosts (as in, not routers).

Are you talking about the latter?

Hello Adrian:

Thanks a  bunch for your review!

Let us address the major concerns first. Please see below:

[PT>] AP -ND  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-ap-nd-05 introduce=
 a new flag to indicate its form of RUID. Other may come in the future. It =
is important that it does signal the type because that triggers the validat=
ion flow.=20

>=20
[PT>] A pure RFC 6775 6LR/6LBR will not need to know the difference, since =
it cannot validate a thing anyway. It will figure that the field is an EUI =
64. As you point out, the additional risk vs. an implementation of the upda=
te is that the name spaces are not differentiated. So there is a (very^64 r=
emote) risk that a crypto token ends up with the same value as an EUI 64 in=
 the network; for that to have an impact, it would take that 2 nodes regist=
er a same address. Note that the Ap ND token is not expected to be used a I=
ID. In other words, for the use that we make of the RUID, there is no real =
issue that an older implementation confuses the name spaces. Note that AP-N=
D may have 2 devices form the same RUID from 2 different keys. Then again, =
very bad luck. Still, not real damage even if that happens unless it is don=
e willingly. DFrom the AP-ND perspective, that is address protection, one n=
ode could control the other's address but it does not even know they exist.

[PT>]=20
[PT>] This is defined in the specs that provide those variations; in the ca=
se of AP ND there is a proof of ownership challenge of the RUID. You own th=
e RUID if you have the key, and then you are entitled to register and use t=
he address... A router that supports the RFC 6775 update and not any of the=
 coming specs cannot process the RUID differently than a RFC6775-only route=
r. Which is OK as long as the extensions are backwards compatible, IOW the =
RUID can be used as a unique token.

>=20
[PT>] We could live without the 6CIO. The draft does not seem to be very mu=
ch used and for backward compatibility we cannot depend on it.
 Still I think it is a good idea to expose capabilities and then start.  Th=
is draft encourages to start using it more now.
Unsure what to do here, I need to take the pulse of the WG.

[PT>] Yes, it is missing in 10.2 though present in 10.1. I do not see a rea=
son to make them different, so that would be:
' The policy is "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" [RFC8126]'.=20

Take care,

Dear all

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-14#section-7.1.1 =
defines new capability bits for use in the 6CIO,  which was introduced by R=
FC7400 to announce support of the spec.
When there is no 6CIO, there's a plan B using EUI-64 as RUID and IID in a N=
S(EARO), which is fully backward compatible, and see if the response has an=
 EARO or not from the T flag.
Adrian indicates that a double mechanism is complexity. For backwards compa=
tibility we need to be able to live without 6CIO. Still 6CIO seems to be a =
good mechanism to generalize and that's why we used it.

So should we keep the CIO mechanism, or should we drop it?

I'm not clear, about this, but presumably the presence of a 6CIO is backward
compatible. That is, an implementation that does not support 6CIO but receives
one does not crash, and either ignores it or tells the sender that something odd
was received.
 
So 6CIO serves much the same purpose as the T-flag and it seems (to me!) you
could use on or the other (or both, as you have done!)
 
I tend to disagree with Carsten that putting flags in MBZ fields typically has
worse backwards compatibility. They were defined as MBZ (must ignore)
specifically to be forward compatible with new usage.

Dear all
 
Quoting Adrian's RTG DIR review:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-14#section-7.1.1
defines new capability bits for use in the 6CIO,  which was introduced by
RFC7400 to announce support of the spec.
When there is no 6CIO, there's a plan B using EUI-64 as RUID and IID in a
NS(EARO), which is fully backward compatible, and see if the response has an
EARO or not from the T flag.
Adrian indicates that a double mechanism is complexity. For backwards
compatibility we need to be able to live without 6CIO. Still 6CIO seems to be a
good mechanism to generalize and that's why we used it.
 
So should we keep the CIO mechanism, or should we drop it?
 
Pascal

Hi all,

I'd like to share my comments on draft-watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment-00.txt.

   LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding
   https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-watteyne-6lo-minimal-fragment-00.txt

I have four comments:

[1]
> 1.  Overview of 6LoWPAN Fragmentation
> (snip)
>   In Figure 1, node A has sent fragments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 to node B, node
>   B has received fragments 1, 2, 3, 6 from node A, fragment 5 is still
>   being transmitted at the link layer from node A to node B.

It'd be nice to explain the figure a little bit more, the symbol of '#' and
numbers above the boxes, like this:

   In Figure 1, a packet forwarded by node A to node B is cut into
   nine fragments, from fragment 1 to fragment 9. Each of them is
   represented with '#' symbol. Node A has sent fragments 1, 2, 3, 5,
   6 to node B, node B has received fragments 1, 2, 3, 6 from node A,
   fragment 5 is still being transmitted at the link layer from node A
   to node B.

This would also need another explanatory note after this paragraph;
for instance, "note that if node E has multiple network interfaces,
the VRB would have (5) the link-layer address of the sender of the
fragment it received, and (6) the link-layer address of the sender of
the fragment it will use."

Technically, each fragment is identified by the combination of the
source link-layer address, the destination link-layer address, and the
datagram_tag as explained in Section 1.

(excerpt from Section 1)

I guess the reason to use the destination link-layer address is
that the text shown above and RFC 4944 take into account cases
when a node has multiple network interfaces.

Then, E's VRB Table in Fugure 3 should have "L2 dest" as a the
"incoming" column and "L2 src" as a the "outgoing" column. But,
putting them into Figure 3 seems too much. Just adding note would
be enough, I think.

For the explanation about the basic mechanism of VRB, can we assume
fragments of an IPv6 packet are always received in order?

In general, fragments could be received out of order. Because of that,
an intermediate node cannot determine which fragment is the last one
for the correspondent packet without any state on received fragments
in the VRB Table. Every active VRB entry is valid until its
expiration.

However, I believe reordering of fragments rarely happens in reality
with networks which 6tisch WG or 6lo WG deal with. If this is the
case, I'd suggest to keep the paragraph as it is since it's simple and
easy to understand. We may add some text clarifying that this
optimization works under a certain condition, that is, fragments are
received in order.

I agree.

The last sentence is forgotten to be removed...?
