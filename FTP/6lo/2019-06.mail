So, there no specific first initial framework that this solution has=0A=

My questions where more coming from the aspect, how do you have been=0A=
part of developing this technical solution without having at least one=0A=

=0A=

Hi Magnus,

Thanks for the great response, we will update the draft accordingly.

Hi,

Thanks for providing some background information. From my perspective I
think there are some benefit to indicate the context the solution was
developed in. Note this is really comment level and not required.

The proposed sentence appears problematic from two perspective. One that it
might be an overly complex solution for certain closed systems.
Secondly, is it really "call admission" rather than flow admission?

I think the right way forward here is that you document the security issues
that anyone that intend to deploy this needs to consider. I think that
discussion can discuss potential mitigations, but without specific surround
contexts it is impossible to mandate any such.

Hi Magnus,

Thanks for your detailed review and really appreciate your time taken for
the effort !!!!.

Please find our below response for the frame work query addressed by you.

One of the main use cases of the draft is the industrial automation and
control applications. The end point of such applications puts the deadline
information as per its delay requirements.
 
I agree that the underlying 6Lo network needs to ensure that the deadline is
met using its delay sensitive routing and scheduling mechanisms while
forwarding the packet along the path. The 6Lo network can support such a QoS
requirement through end-to-end provisioning of the required network
resources either centrally and/or in a distributed fashion .

In the case of a 6tisch network, one could think of setting up tracks
[draft-ietf-6tisch-architecture] along with delay aware Scheduling Function
implemented by the intermediate nodes. The deadline draft works well within
the context of the framework described in the draft-6tisch-architecture
draft. The 6tisch architecture draft defines tracks which could either be
set up by a centralised entity PCE or by setting up tracks in a distributed
fashion by reserving network resources that provide end-to-end delay
guarantees. Packets of application flows can be sent over these tracks and
scheduled based on their deadlines. The CAC can be exercised where
reservation fails for a new track setup.  There are situations like
asynchronous time critical emergency messages where track set up delay is
not acceptable.  In such cases, we can use distributed on-the-fly scheduling
using 6P protocol described in RFC 8480 that takes into consideration the
deadline information. 
 
There are several deadline based scheduling algorithms that have proposed in
the literature including the basic Earliest Deadline First (EDF). Based on
our deadline draft, we implemented this scheme over a 6tisch network running
on OpenWSN protocol stack and our draft implementation has been merged with
the OpenWSN environment for future downloads too.
 
We would be happy to add some additional text specifying that ** a network
monitoring entity with call admission policy is expected to be in place for
observation and consequently better results during real implementations**.

Hope this address your few concerns and based on your response we will
update the draft.

Happy to receive your further thoughts and valuable inputs.

Thanks & Regards,
Lijo Thomas

Yes, I think so, as it points to a requirement to consider either admission
control or other solutions to keep the interaction on an acceptable level.

So, there no specific first initial framework that this solution has been
developed to support? And you say you do not want to deal with policy, and
instead put that on the ones attempting to utilize it.
Considering the security issues, and the higher layer requirements that this
solution appears to create I think that is far from optimal. I really think
this document should have a section making the assumptions about its
expected deployments clear.

Sure, but the document could make it clear that there exist a need to
monitor the actual performance to know if the application will work
successful

Please do.

Ok, I can agree that there is difficult to be descriptive here. As long at
the potential impact is a discussed security issue I think this will be
considered addressed.

My questions where more coming from the aspect, how do you have been part of
developing this technical solution without having at least one framework
that addresses the raised issue? 

Thus, my preference that in the absence of a framework to point at, that the
assumptions on the hypothetical framework are documented.

The proposed sentence appears problematic from two perspective. One that=0A=

Hey all,

I do have some questions related to fragment forwarding or fragmentation =
in general and I hope I can get some help here.

Right now I=27m not sure what values I have to set for DATAGRAM_SIZE and =
DATAGRAM_OFFSET.

As per my understanding at the LBR - DATAGRAM_SIZE has to be the size of =
the incoming IPv6 packet before transforming it into a 6lowpan packet. Fo=
r instance if I do a ping from a local address in the same subnet as my w=
ireless network is:
ABCD::1 to ABCD::EUI64 using linux ping6 command with option -s 100
That will result in which packet size 100byte payload, 8byte udp header, =
16byte src, dst address each -> total 140byte =3F

Here I=27m not sure since I do have an implementation for traditional hop=
-by-hop forwarding which differs in some points from rfc4944 in my eyes.

Following wireshark snippet shows the use case I have tested so far, wher=
e 1f2e is the dagroot and fd44 first hop node. Here datagram size is 138b=
yte not 140byte

[cid:image001.png@01D51D07.6393E0F0]

The next thing what I=27m not sure is, where do I start to count my paylo=
ad bytes I=27m referring with DATAGRAM_OFFSET in frag n packets. For the =
following packets it seems to be quite easy since they only contain FRAGN=
 Header and the payload beside IEEE802.15.4 header and MIC (if secured).
I=27m using rpl-source routing so my headers will vary from hop to hop si=
nce there are ipv6 header, iphc header, routing headers with paging dispa=
tch and so forth. The stack implement RFC6282, RFC8025.

RFC4944 says something about first octet of the datagram (e.g. start of t=
he ipv6 header) which can be offset zero. Here my confusion starts. If I =
assume everything after ipv6 header belongs to the payload I have to stri=
p the packet at each hop downstream=3F Since the DATAGRAM_OFFSET should b=
e always a multiples of 8 octets I wonder how I should handle this in an =
elegant way. Or is the payload in my ping case starting with icmpv6 heade=
r with 0x80 (ICMPV6_ECHO_REQUEST), which would make more sense for me.

In some ietf slides I already found some issue statements that some re-fr=
agmentation might be required at intermediate hops and therefore one shou=
ld try to get all the slack into Frag1. I=27m honestly don=27t understand=
 what is meant by that, I have never heard of it. Maybe an explanation is=
 part of the solution for my problem.

As you can see I=27m somehow lost and any help is appreciated - Thanks in=
 advance

ys something about first octet of the datagram (e.g. start of the ipv6 he=

 everything after ipv6 header belongs to the payload I have to strip the =
packet at each hop downstream=3F Since the DATAGRAM_OFFSET should be alwa=
ys a multiples of 8 octets I wonder how I should handle this in an elegan=
t way. Or is the payload in my ping case
 starting with icmpv6 header with 0x80 (ICMPV6_ECHO_REQUEST), which would=
 make more sense for me.

If the assumption is that any IPv6 over NFC is only send in secured =

therefore a gateway should probably not just take the IPv6 packet and =

Hi Pascal,

Please find below my review of draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-03.

In my humble opinion, this is a very readable document. In addition, the
document provides the motivations for some decisions made, which I
appreciated while reading the document.

Below you can find my comments and/or suggestions. They are mostly
editorial, although some of them are technical.

I hope this helps.

Cheers,

Carles


-------------- Review --------------

- Page 2: "in all cases" can be removed

- Page 2: "a firmware upgrades" -> perhaps remove "a" (or apply other
                                                       changes)

- Page 3: "10Kbytes" -> "10 kbyte"

- Page 3: "requires to reassemble the full packet at each hop".

          The sentence should probably be modified. At least, "requires" is
          probably not the right verb here. As e.g. stated in
          draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment: "it may be beneficial for a
          forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in its entirety
          before forwarding it.  This has always been possible with the
          original fragmentation design of RFC4944".

- Page 3: "... and trigger the retransmission of the full datagram".

          Perhaps "... potentially triggering" the retransmission..." (since
          datagram retransmission will only happen if an upper layer
          protocol requires so).

- Section 2.2: "in the following documents" --> "in the following document"

- Section 2.4: "miss-associated" -> "misassociated"

- Section 2.4, last paragraph: "MLPS" --> "MPLS"

- Section 3, first paragraph: "A new format for fragment is introduces"

          --> "A new format for fragments is introduced"

- Section 3, last paragraph: "... consistently with in Section 2"

          --> "... consistently with Section 2"

- Section 4.1, 2nd paragraph: "the fragment number".

          This term appears here for the first time. Perhaps some forward
          reference might help the reader.

- Section 4.2, 2nd paragraph: "is required protect"

          --> "is required to protect"

- Section 4.2, 2nd paragraph: "progressing alon"

          --> "progressing along"

- Section 4.3: "The compression of the Hop Limit, of the source and
  destination addresses"

          --> Perhaps mention that these are IPv6 header fields (even if it
              might seem obvious)?

- Section 4.3, 1st paragraph: "datagram_size"

          --> Perhaps add a forward reference to section where this field is
              defined?

- Section 5, 2nd paragraph: "the node that is the source MAC address"

          --> "the node that corresponds to the source MAC address"

- Section 5, 2nd paragraph: "the selected tag"

          --> Perhaps better sticking to "Datagram_tag"

- The line above Fig. 1: "page" --> "Page" (as defined in RFC 8025)

- Section 5, last paragraph of intro: "datagram-tag" -> "Datagram_tag"

- Several instances: "recomposition" --> "reassembly" ?

- Section 5.1. The text before Fig. 2 uses terms such as "the sequence
  field" that have not yet been introduced. Perhaps indicate they are
  introduced later (e.g. in Fig. 2), or some other solution.

- Section 5.1, 2nd paragraph: "seem be" --> "seem to be"

- Page 9: "Fragment_size" field. I was wondering whether this field is
  actually needed. Is this used just in case a lower layer technology uses
  padding?

- Page 9: "this field indicates the datagram_size of the compressed
  datagram"

         --> "... of the *potentially* compressed datagram" (or some similar
             approach), as perhaps in some (rare) cases, a packet will
             not be compressed?

- Page 10, first lines: "may store" --> "may be stored"

- Page 10, 2nd bullet: "When the Sequence is not 0, this field indicates the
  offset of the fragment **in the compressed form**."

         --> I was wondering what is the meaning of "in the compressed form"
             in the previous sentence. Which is the expected representation
             of the offset of the fragment?

- End of 5.1: "If the fragment cannot be forwarded or routed, then an abort
  RFRAG-ACK is sent back to the source."

         --> Perhaps add a forward reference where the concept of "abort
             RFRAG-ACK" is defined.

- Page 11: there is no explicit text about "Datagram_tag" in the RFRAG
  Acknowledgment subsection, below Figure 5.

- Page 12, 1st paragraph. The terms "All 0's" and "All 1's" may be well
  known for LPWANners. :) But I was wondering if perhaps it might be clearer
  to say something like "A bitmap with all bits set to 0...", etc.

- If a datagram is carried by 20 fragments, and all fragments are
  successfully received, is the FULL bitmap the only way to indicate so? Or
  would a bitmap with the first 20 bits set to 1 and the remaining bits set
  to 0 also work?

- Section 6, 3rd line: "a one or more fragments" -> "one or more fragments"

- Section 6, 4th line: "a standalone header"

        --> Does this mean "without a payload"? If yes, perhaps something
            along these lines could be added for extra clarity.

- Section 6, end of 1st paragraph: "by reversing the MPLS operation"

        --> "MPLS-like"?

- Section 6, 2nd paragraph: "Te maximum number" --> "The maximum number"

- Section 6, 2nd paragraph: "the 6LoWPAN endpoint that reassembles
  the packets at 6LoWPAN level (the receiver)"

        --> Swap with "it" in the previous sentence?

- Section 6, 3rd paragraph: "a ARQ timer" --> "an ARQ timer"

- Section 6, 3rd paragraph. A reader may wonder which are the names and
  values for the parameters for number of retries, timers, etc. Perhaps a
  reference to Section 7 could be added.

- Page 13, 2nd paragraph: "last fragment of a series"

        --> Is this the same as "Last fragment of a window"? If yes, perhaps
            use "window" (which has been introduced before).

- Page 13, 2nd paragraph: "RFRAG Acknowledgment Request" and
  "acknowledgment request" are not defined terms, whereas "Ack-Request bit"
  is defined.

- Page 13, 2nd paragraph, last sentence: does "it" refer to "Delaying the
  acknowledgment" or to the "round trip delay computation" ?

- In some instances, "cancel" is used. I was wondering if "abort" refers to
  the same. If yes, then perhaps just stick to one term?

- Page 14. "alternate routes not possible" -> "alternate routes are not
  possible"

- I understand that the document has been designed with Route-Over in mind,
  but I was wondering if the document might also work in Mesh-Under. Any
  thoughts?

- Page 15, last paragraph: "to the previous router"

      --> "to the previous node" (since perhaps the previous node could be a
           host?)

- Section 6.2, 2nd paragraph. "until" -> "Until"

- Section 6.2, 3rd paragraph. If the minimal MTU that decreases is in one of
  the intermediate hops (i.e. not the first hop), how does the sender detect
  such event?

- Section 7.1, 1st paragraph: "as echoing ECN should always be on"

      --> "as echoing ECN is always on" (or is the opposite possible?)

- Section 7.1, 1st paragraph: "to the sender that is in control"

      --> "to the sender, which is in control"

- Section 7.1. Should there be default values for the parameters defined?

- Section 7.1. There are two UseECN entries!

- Section 7.2. "The management system should monitor..."

     --> Any hint on how this could be done? E.g. each node self-monitors
         its performance? An external NMS system collects such information
         and makes decisions?

- Section 8. Some of the content of Section 7 in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-cocoa-03 may apply here.

- Page 22: "all fragments are resent" --> "all fragments would need to be
  resent..."

- Page 22, 4th paragraph. "Mesh Addressing" and "Mesh-Under" are mentioned.
  Since the document focuses on Route-Over, are these needed?

- I understand that the document has been designed with Route-Over in mind,
  but I was wondering if the document might also enable the same
  functionality for Mesh-Under (not sure if with perhaps minor adaptations).
  Any thoughts?

The specification, LLCP-1.3, is not free of charge. I also bought it. I hav=

<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have read S 3.4 repeatedly, but am unable to work out the mapping of=

r>
&gt; works and then perhaps I can assist you with the text.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Section 3.4 has the original intention to introduce how MTU of NFC Data Lin=
k is extendable. So, the figure 2 shows LLCP&#39;s option field for the ext=
ension. When two NFC devices start to connect with each other with LLCP, th=
ey has an option whether they extend its MTU size or not. I think exchangin=
g the option field like figure 2 between two NFC devices is quite simple. O=
ne thing that Benjamin pointed and I agreed is that the value of the figure=
 2 must be mentioned with 0x480(this is a size of extension to cover MTU of=
 IPv6, 1280) in the section 3.2. So I will put this in the next draft. <br>
Please refer to my response on the Benjamin&#39;s DISCUSS. <br>

Sorry, that comment was from Qin - the formula should be added to the docum=

Yes please -- simply clarifying that the terms mean the same thing
will address the issue.

I don't think the execution is relevant when it was obviously a bad
idea in the first place.
This is like putting rabid weasels in your pants, and later expressing
regret at having chosen those particular rabid weasels and that pair
of pants.

Dear 6Lo WG,

The draft entitled "6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery" has been recently
reviewed by WG participants. Several comments have been made and, as a
result, the draft has been updated twice. The draft editor has made a
request to the chairs to initiate a WG Last Call (WGLC).

This message opens a two-week WGLC for draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-04:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery

The WGLC will end on the 26th of June.

Please send your comments on the mailing list. Feedback in the form of
short support statements is also useful.

Thanks,

Shwetha and Carles

Hello Yatch

This dates a bit but I think none of us answered so let me take a look:

> (1) https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-01#sectio=
n-2.2

> Here, "Assuming a 1kB reassembly buffer"? (singular)

Fixed in 02

> These two drafts has newer versions:

Version are automatically added at the next publication but I replaced draf=
t-thubert by draft-ietf


> https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly-01
> https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-02
>=20

Many (delayed) thanks, Yatch. Hope I see you in Montreal and go for that Me=
xican again.

I see the scenario. Thx.

True!

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda based on the DRAFT AGENDA
for IETF105.  Remember that there is still quite some potential for
changes.

Conflicts that meet the eye:  COSE/TEEP again!
ROLL/SUIT/DINRG and 6TISCH/ACE are maybe slightly less annoying.
(The poor TEEP people get to both start and end the week, too.)
LAKE and LOOPS -- two BOFs at the same time?

All times are EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) =3D=3D UTC -4 hours.
(Pure UTC times at https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc are
useful for those who want to listen from remote.)

Abstract:
   This document gives an overview of LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding.
   When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be
   beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in
   its entirety before forwarding it.  This has always been possible
   with the original fragmentation design of RFC4944.  This document is
   a companion document to [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly],
   which details the virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) implementation
   technique which reduces the latency and increases end-to-end
   reliability in route-over forwarding.

I don't think this changes the issue. Your response below implies that 
the address is stable only over very short periods of time, and that 
would address my concern. If that's true, then the solution would be to 
add text here that qualifies how long the address is stable (e.g.: 
"...such an IID should guarantee a stable IPv6 address during the course 
of a single connection, because...")

Dear 6Lo WG,

The WGLC for draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-04 is now closed.

During the actual WGLC interval, no feedback on the document has been
received. However, right before the WGLC, two detailed reviews have been
made, on revisions -02 and -03, which have led to the updated document
versions -03 and -04, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the
document is now ready for progressing towards the IESG.

We would like to thank the reviewers of revisions -02 and -03 for their
thorough reviews.

Thanks,

Shwetha and Carles
