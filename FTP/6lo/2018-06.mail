Abstract:
   This specification updates RFC 6775 - 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery, to
   clarify the role of the protocol as a registration technique,
   simplify the registration operation in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to
   provide enhancements to the registration capabilities and mobility
   detection for different network topologies including the backbone
   routers performing proxy Neighbor Discovery in a low power network.

Hello folks,

I still think it would be a significant improvement to refactor the 
specification of the 6BBR mandates to live entirely within 
draft-ietf-6lo-backbone-router (BBR).  For that reason, I have prepared 
a summary of the changes to draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update (6775bis) that 
would be required.  I left out a few occurrences of the term 6BBR that 
could obviously be deleted.  All citations of 
I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router would also be deleted.  It might be argued 
that some of the current citations of the BBR document represent 
normative references.


>    o  Registration via an IPv6 ND proxy over a Backbone Link (6BBR)

This bullet point would fit well in BBR and does not need to be in 6775bis.


>    Backbone Router (6BBR):  A logical network function in an IPv6 router
>          that proxies the 6LoWPAN ND operations specified in this

This definition already needs to be in BBR.

This sentence should be deleted from 6775bis definition for 
"Registration", regardless of BBR.

Here, the list of registrars does not need to include 6BBR, and the BBR 
document would simply add 6BBR as a registrar.  By the way, "registrar" 
is an undefined term in 6775bis, and it does merit a definition.

Logically speaking, "L" and "B" should be defined in 6775bis, and "P" 
should be defined in BBR.


>                      Figure 4: (Re-)Registration Flow

Figure 4 in 6775bis should be modified so that the proxy NS and proxy NA 
are not shown in 6775bis, but the current Figure 4 should be situated 
within the BBR document with explanations about the proxy messages and 
NS(DAD) operation.

Old in 6775bis:

If there are multiple 6LRs in the routing path from 6LN to 6LBR, I don't 
think this statement is completely accurate.  It would be accurate if 
the words "to the 6BBR" were omitted.

and

I think these statements remain accurate if 6BBR is replaced by 6LBR.

This statement *really* belongs in the BBR draft and does not belong in 
6775bis.


>    The LLN nodes depend on the 6LBR and the 6BBR for their operation.


This statement cannot be true in networks that don't have any 6BBRs.  
And, it's not exactly true in LLNs that have peer-to-peer routing, 
either.  In any case, a modified version deleting 6BBR is pretty much 
true (i.e., a lot "more true") and depicts the security point just as well.

This statement should fit much better in the BBR draft.

===========================================================


If it were considered acceptable to make the changes indicated above, I 
would be very happy to supply a revised version of 6775bis by next 
Tuesday.  I have already provided a thorough review for the current BBR 
document and expect to be making additional discussion points after 
tomorrow.

Thanks in advance for your consideration of my proposal.

Regards,
Charlie P.

    <p>This statement cannot be true in networks that don't have any

      pretty much true (i.e., a lot "more true") and depicts the

      <p>Hello folks,</p>
      <p>Over the last month I've been reviewing and making editorial
        suggestions for the following three documents:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>- draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>- draft-ietf-6lo-ap-nd<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>- draft-ietf-6lo-backbone-router</li>
      </ol>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>During the reviews, I had a hard time keeping it straight in my
        mind about which mandates belong where in the documents.  I
        eventually have come to believe that the 6BBR stuff really
        belongs in document (3) and the underlying parts of the extended
        registration specification belongs in document (1) -- where they
        are now.<br>
        <br>
        So I asked Pascal about that, and Pascal said the ship had
        sailed.</p>
      <p>Then I asked Suresh about it, and Suresh said it was too late.</p>
      <p>So that's too bad.  But I had another idea.  Maybe we SHOULD
        anyway locate all of the 6BBR material in document number 3,
        where it belongs, and just arrange things so that document 3
        *updates* document 1 whenever document 3 can finally be
        published.</p>
      <p>Or, alternatively, my forlorn hope would be that I could
        rearrange the text according to the suggestion above within the
        next week or so, and avoid the temporary mislocation of the 6BBR
        mandates.  Before doing so, it would be required for me to
        identify the texts to be moved on this mailing list so as to be
        very specific about the task at hand.  Maybe a few more days
        detour in May, 2018, but maybe a lot easier time for future
        implementers of these important specifications.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for your consideration of my request!</p>
      <p>Regards,<br>
        Charlie P.<br>

Hello folks,

After a long discussion with Pascal about the proposed changes, we came 
to be much closer in our outlook on the material that is needed in 
6775bis (i.e., draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update).  The least confusing and 
most straightforward way I can summarize the results is to revise my 
earlier email.

In 6775bis, we can define something called a "routing registrar" as a 
feature-rich node that is both a registrar and provides Internet 
reachability for the LLN multilink subnet.  The intention in 6775bis is, 
then, to specify registration signaling to meet the needs that are 
identified for such a routing registrar.  The BBR document, on the other 
hand, is intended to specify a particular kind of routing registrar, 
which is to be called a 6BBR.

My understanding is that this has actually been mostly the intention, 
especially given the opportunity to develop 6775bis and the BBR document 
in parallel.  The documents are intended to work well together (and also 
with the AP-ND document).  Yet it is also intended to have a clear 
separation between what the 6LNs, 6LRs, and 6LBRs expect from a routing 
registrar, versus the mandates and specification details as needed for 
the kind of routing registrar known as a 6BBR.

The intention is still to submit revision 
draft-ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update-21.txt by early next week.

Better to retain the bullet and reword as follows:

  * Registration to an IPv6 ND proxy

Definitions for "registrar" and "routing registrar" will be provided.  
The last sentence will make it clear that the list of example registrars 
is not intended to be exclusive of other possibilities.

The "P" flag will be redefined to signal the presence of a routing 
registrar, and retained in 6775bis.

The revised figure 4 in 6775bis will attempt to clarify the above 
architectural considerations.  The Figure 4 currently in 6775bis will be 
introduced into the BBR document; it is already specialized to the case 
of 6BBRs.

New in 6775bis:

    o  The Target Address in the NS containing the EARO is now the field
       that indicates the address that is being registered, as opposed to
       the Source Address field as specified in [RFC6775] (see
       Section 5.5).   This change enables a 6LBR to proxy the registration
       of an address that belongs to a 6LN to a routing registrar, and also
       avoids in most cases the use of an address as source
       address before it is registered.

Here, "6BBR" can be replaced by "routing registrar".  I still have a 
concern about disallowing other kinds of registrations, though. More later.

The statement could be replaced by "The LLN nodes depend on a 6LBR and

This will be reworded to be aligned with the abovementioned passages.

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda based on the DRAFT AGENDA
for IETF102.  Remember that there is still quite some potential for
changes.

ACE vs. DISPATCH seems to become a common occurrance; at this rate,
I'll probably never see a DISPATCH meeting again.  CBOR vs. 6LO is
maybe just a personal problem for me, throwing in TEEP on top is a bit
weird, though.  6TISCH vs. SUIT is probably painful for the few
individuals who care about security in both.

All times are EDT (UTC-0400).  (You can get pure UTC times on
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc, for those who want to
listen from remote.)

Abstract:
   This specification updates RFC 6775 - 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery, to
   clarify the role of the protocol as a registration technique,
   simplify the registration operation in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to
   provide enhancements to the registration capabilities and mobility
   detection for different network topologies including the Routing
   Registrars performing routing for host routes and/or proxy Neighbor
   Discovery in a low power network.

Hi Gabriel,

Thanks for the follow-up.

Yes, we would like to request some time for Montreal. Our aim would be 
explaining the following:

- The updates in -03 (which we plan to publish before the cut-off date),
including text on network formation/initialization.

- Related with the updates, we have teamed up with Michael Sprk and his
colleagues, from Graz University of Technology, who are the authors of the
BLEach implementation of RFC 7668 [1]. We are already running our own
local copy (at UPC) of a BLEach scenario, which we plan to use as the
basis to implement draft-ietf-6lo-blemesh.

- Since in the past there have been questions on the Bluetooth SIG
proposal for BLE mesh networking, it might be good to show one slide on
the topic, now that the "Bluetooth mesh" specification (from Bluetooth
SIG) is publicly available, explaining the differences with RFC 7668 and
draft-ietf-6lo-blemesh.

I guess a 10-min slot should work, but a shorter slot would be fine if
needed to accommodate other slot requests.

Please let us know if you have any comments.

Thanks!

Carles

Hi all,


You may remember last month I shared an academic paper titled Design Consid=
erations for Low Power Internet Protocols. This paper discussed some of the=
 experiences my research group had implementing 6LoWPAN for the Tock embedd=
ed OS, presented an interoperability analysis between several open-source 6=
LoWPAN implementations, and concluded with some takeaways for writing Inter=
net protocols for low resource devices. This paper still remains in the rev=
iew process for an academic conference.


In anticipation of the upcoming IETF 102 in Montreal, I have converted the =
major points of this paper into an Internet-Draft, to make them easier to d=
iscuss in an IETF setting, and to focus the content towards the IETF audien=
ce.


This Internet-Draft is titled draft-ayers-low-power-interop-00, and can be =
found here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ayers-low-power-interop/=
 for anyone who is interested.


Best,


Hudson Ayers
