Abstract:
   RFC 7668 describes the adaptation of 6LoWPAN techniques to enable
   IPv6 over Bluetooth low energy networks that follow the star
   topology.  However, recent Bluetooth specifications allow the
   formation of extended topologies as well.  This document defines how
   IPv6 is transported over Bluetooth low energy mesh networks.




Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Yes they do.  Just because a device is resource constrained doesn't mean it=
 can't
leak link-local addresses.   In fact we have plenty of evidence that leakin=
g
link-local addresses can easily happen by accident (or programmer neglect),
in any number of Internet protocols (DNS, SIP, SMTP, etc.)

Ok, will see what I can do.

If the link is a multi-access link, and one of the devices can be
compromised, then it can potentially be used to eavesdrop on communication
between two other entities on the link.  So it's not wired vs wireless
so much as point-to-point vs multi-access.

Depends on the link-layer protocol.  Some link layers (e.g., ones
that don't support multicast/broadcast) don't use ND and so address scannin=
g
may still be an issue.

I think you're still assuming that link-local addresses can never leak
via higher layer protocols, whereas we know they can.  So link-local addres=
ses
are still an issue for the off-link case.  Even though an attacker can't
use them to communicate with the constrained device, they can still result
in privacy vulnerabilities.

Right, in cases like fixed services that might even be resolvable via
DNS or some other mechanism, public addresses are used and privacy of such
addresses is not an issue.  However, the point is that that IETF should not
design protocols that can ONLY support such cases.  (The draft is a bit
softer than saying that though, it just says that your Privacy Consideratio=
ns
section needs to have a discussion of the issues, and then the IETF communi=
ty
and the IESG can decide whether there is IETF consensus on it.)

Well there's multiple parts of "ND".   The NUD part is still relevant in
all cases.  The Address Resolution part can be eliminated in some cases
(and indeed it's up to each link-layer protocol to say how Address Resoluti=
on
is done, which defaults to normal ND if you say nothing).

One cannot positively tell the difference simply by looking at an address.
One needs additional information to say for sure, because ultimately it's
up to each link (or maybe even finer granularity).  But for things like
address-to-string conversion ("pretty-printing") purposes, some implementat=
ions
(like Windows) do have a random generation algorithm that avoids colliding
with the patterns you mention, and do result in a max entropy of ~63 bits.
So far I don't see any reason the draft needs to discuss this point though.

Right, will fix (it's correct in the equation at top of page 4 but then
the text below it wasn't consistent with it).

It's not worth noting because the same could be said for TCP or HTTP
or ICMP.  The "stealth mode" is a property of a host firewall in front of
it but on the same device.  Section 5 of RFC 7288 (which the draft
references) already contains a discussion of this point, and just uses
TCP and ICMP as examples, and that text equally applies to COAP.

Thanks, will fix.

Ok, will see what I can do.

Why should it be noted?  Can you point me to a 6man RFC (since many
6man RFCs mention EUI-64 and EUI-48) that notes that the term is
trademarked?  Is there an RFC style guide directive on such matters?

> An EUI-64 may have 40, 36, or

When the OUI is unknown, the lack of such knowledge provides a few
more bits of entropy since the attacker has to at least try any well-known
OUI's and do a search within each one.  For example, if there's 64+
possible OUI's in use, that's around 6 more bits of entropy.   An off-link
attacker cannot, without additional information, know what the link type is
and so has to try OUIs without being able to narrow it down to OUI's for th=
at
link type.

Random MAC addresses was the intent, but "MAC" as a term only applies
to specific link types.  Maybe "randomized link-layer addresses" is a
better term, so I'll use that.

Such a recommendation may be too strong for some cases (it would indeed
be sufficient, but not necessary).  For example, if the link lifetime is
usually <1 second, then privacy IIDs might be overkill.  The point of
the first bullet is to say that an IP-over-Foo doc should contain such
a discussion.  However, perhaps your point is that it could say that
using privacy addresses is one easy way to meet the requirement.

That is, I don't believe there is 6lo WG consensus for stating that
privacy IIDs are RECOMMENDED for routable addresses.

I have no problem adding such a reference.  The point is to say what
privacy considerations need to be addressed in a doc, rather than
details of *how* to address them, in order to leave maximum freedom.
But providing examples as informative references as you suggest is
a good thing.

Agreed, will use "randomized link-layer addresses".

Disagree as noted above.  It applies due to off-link leakage.
(And the IP-over-Foo layer should not make assumptions about
what upper-layer protocols do.)  The risk might be smaller, and hence
it might apply "less", but it still applies.

> Fourth bullet - this advice should not apply to link-local IIDs for devic=
es

Same answer.   The risk might be smaller and hence it might apply "less",
but it still applies.

Again the main point of this draft is not to say what one MUST or MUST NOT =
do
(or rather *how* one MUST or MUST NOT solve some privacy issue),
but rather what issues need to be addressed in a doc, and some recommendati=
ons
("shoulds") on good ways to address them.   So the fact that there's still =
a risk
means there's still a need for text to address them or convincingly (to the=
 IETF
community and to the IESG) explain why some issue doesn't apply to a partic=
ular
IP-over-foo mechanism.

Thanks again for the review,
Dave

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes of the IETF.

        Title           : Privacy Considerations for IPv6 over Networks of Resource-Constrained Nodes
        Author          : Dave Thaler
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations-01.txt
	Pages           : 10
	Date            : 2016-07-06

Abstract:
   This document discusses how a number of privacy threats apply to
   technologies designed for IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained
   nodes, and provides advice to protocol designers on how to address
   such threats in adaptation layer specifications for IPv6 over such
   links.

Ok, I just posted an update in which I tried to take Kerry's feedback into =
account.

Some notes below about what I did, but see the diffs for details.

I did make changes in a number of places, especially any discussion around
address scans, to make the discussion specific to routable addresses.
I put in some text to state my points as well, but the primary focus of
address scan text (and thus the larger number of entropy bits) is for
routable addresses, which I hope is clear in the text now.

I made textual changes, but not organizational changes (table of contents
remains the same) since some points do not clearly delineate that way.
So hopefully it's clear enough in each paragraph now.

I added a minor point about NBMA but the main focus in the text is, I hope,
consistent with I think what your main point is.

As noted earlier, I updated the text so that address scans and the larger
amount of entropy being mainly for routable addresses.

Updated text to discuss firewalls and reword to make it clearer that it's
about dropping unsolicited inbound traffic before it ever reaches
the TCP/ICMP/COAP/whatever layer, and also mentioned network firewalls
in front of the subnet, that have the same effect.

I also reduced the number of occurrences of the "46 bits" number, since tha=
t's
just an example for links that can last 8 years or more.  (Many 6lo links l=
ast
for far less time than that, so we shouldn't over-index on the number 46,
it's just an example.   The key point is to derive the number from the max
expected link lifetime.)

I checked and there is no reference (RFC or draft) as far as anyone I asked=
 knows.
So I didn't mention DHCPv6 in this document, I left it for 6man documents
to discuss since it's not specific to 6lo.

Also the whole section is under the heading of "recommendations" not
"requirements", so they're already implied SHOULD's rather than MUST's
in that sense.   But either way, the security/privacy text in a draft shoul=
d address
the issue, whatever the answer is.

Hi Dave,

Thanks for your edits.  I'm currently on holiday with only a mobile phone
(which works only when the wind blows right) so I'll give comments when
i get back to civilization on Tues.  Hopefully we can have some group
discussion in 6lo if time permits.

Regards, Kerry

&gt; &gt; offer my review of draft-ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations-00.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks for the feedback!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; First, some general comments:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - I find the document clear and understandable, as per Dave&#39;s=
 usual.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - As this document pertains to constrained devices, I think some =
of<br>
&gt; &gt; the concerns expressed in other fora (e.g. leaking link-local add=
ress<br>
&gt; &gt; in email headers) don&#39;t apply here.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes they do.=C2=A0 Just because a device is resource constrained doesn=
&#39;t mean it<br>
&gt; can&#39;t leak link-local addresses.=C2=A0=C2=A0 In fact we have plent=
y of evidence that<br>
&gt; leaking link-local addresses can easily happen by accident (or program=
mer<br>
&gt; neglect), in any number of Internet protocols (DNS, SIP, SMTP, etc.)<b=
r>
<br>
</span>I did make changes in a number of places, especially any discussion =
around<br>
address scans, to make the discussion specific to routable addresses.<br>
I put in some text to state my points as well, but the primary focus of<br>
address scan text (and thus the larger number of entropy bits) is for<br>
routable addresses, which I hope is clear in the text now.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; &gt; - I think it would be helpful to clearly divide the document acco=
rding<br>
&gt; &gt; to threats posed by off-link vs on-link adversaries.=C2=A0 In the=
 off-link<br>
&gt; &gt; case, we are dealing only with routable addresses and information=
 that<br>
&gt; &gt; is at L3 or higher.=C2=A0 This class of threats applies to all ho=
sts, including 6lo.<br>
&gt; &gt; Using a random 60+ bit IID (per prefix?) will mitigate all threat=
s<br>
&gt; &gt; discussed in draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy exce=
pt<br>
&gt; &gt; correlation of activity over time.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Ok, will see what I can do.<br>
<br>
</span>I made textual changes, but not organizational changes (table of con=
tents<br>
remains the same) since some points do not clearly delineate that way.<br>
So hopefully it&#39;s clear enough in each paragraph now.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In the on-link case, are we only concerned with threats that appl=
y to<br>
&gt; &gt; (wireless) data links that are susceptible to eavesdropping, or m=
ust<br>
&gt; &gt; we also be concerned with intruders in the wiring closet?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If the link is a multi-access link, and one of the devices can be comp=
romised,<br>
&gt; then it can potentially be used to eavesdrop on communication between =
two<br>
&gt; other entities on the link.=C2=A0 So it&#39;s not wired vs wireless so=
 much as point-to-<br>
&gt; point vs multi-access.<br>
<br>
</span>I added a minor point about NBMA but the main focus in the text is, =
I hope,<br>
consistent with I think what your main point is.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; &gt; In any event, this<br>
&gt; &gt; class of threats would seem to exclude address scanning (which is=
<br>
&gt; &gt; trivial if an attacker has access to the local link traffic).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Depends on the link-layer protocol.=C2=A0 Some link layers (e.g., ones=
 that don&#39;t<br>
&gt; support multicast/broadcast) don&#39;t use ND and so address scanning =
may still<br>
&gt; be an issue.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - If address scanning is eliminated as a concern (as in cases whe=
re it<br>
&gt; &gt; cannot be prevented), then arguments about &quot;enough entropy&q=
uot; do not<br>
&gt; &gt; apply and locally assigned short addresses have their rightful pl=
ace<br>
&gt; &gt; in forming link-local IIDs.=C2=A0 The side effect of this is to e=
nable<br>
&gt; &gt; maximally efficient RFC 6282 compression for link-local traffic.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think you&#39;re still assuming that link-local addresses can never =
leak via higher<br>
&gt; layer protocols, whereas we know they can.=C2=A0 So link-local address=
es are still<br>
&gt; an issue for the off-link case.=C2=A0 Even though an attacker can&#39;=
t use them to<br>
&gt; communicate with the constrained device, they can still result in priv=
acy<br>
&gt; vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
</span>As noted earlier, I updated the text so that address scans and the l=
arger<br>
amount of entropy being mainly for routable addresses.<br>
<div><div class=3D"h5"><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - Concerns about correlation over time may not apply to certain<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; classes of devices (fixed servers) or applications (e.g. building=
<br>
&gt; &gt; automation, where associating link-layer address with location is=
 a<br>
&gt; &gt; feature, not a bug).=C2=A0 In some cases, it may simply be imprac=
tical to<br>
&gt; &gt; change link-layer address on a frequent basis (e.g. it is common =
in<br>
&gt; &gt; the case of MS/TP nodes to set the L2 address via DIP switches).<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Right, in cases like fixed services that might even be resolvable via =
DNS or<br>
&gt; some other mechanism, public addresses are used and privacy of such<br=
>
&gt; addresses is not an issue.=C2=A0 However, the point is that that IETF =
should not<br>
&gt; design protocols that can ONLY support such cases.=C2=A0 (The draft is=
 a bit softer<br>
&gt; than saying that though, it just says that your Privacy Considerations=
 section<br>
&gt; needs to have a discussion of the issues, and then the IETF community =
and<br>
&gt; the IESG can decide whether there is IETF consensus on it.)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - It has been suggested that ND might be eliminated in some cases=
 to<br>
&gt; &gt; further increase bandwidth efficiency.=C2=A0 (For example, in cas=
es where a<br>
&gt; &gt; locally-assigned short identifier has been assigned at L2 and is =
then<br>
&gt; &gt; used to form an IID, ND is redundant.)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Well there&#39;s multiple parts of &quot;ND&quot;.=C2=A0=C2=A0 The NUD=
 part is still relevant in all<br>
&gt; cases.=C2=A0 The Address Resolution part can be eliminated in some cas=
es (and<br>
&gt; indeed it&#39;s up to each link-layer protocol to say how Address Reso=
lution is<br>
&gt; done, which defaults to normal ND if you say nothing).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; AFAIK, there hasn&#39;t been any<br>
&gt; &gt; discussion about how to tell the difference between L2-derived an=
d<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;random&quot; IIDs.=C2=A0 We might identify L2-derived IIDs =
as those containing<br>
&gt; &gt; the 0xFFFE pattern in the middle, or not having the 0xFFFE patter=
n but<br>
&gt; &gt; having the U/L bit =3D 0 in the IID.=C2=A0 This would exclude the=
se patterns<br>
&gt; &gt; from valid privacy IIDs and result in a maximum entropy of ~63 bi=
ts.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; One cannot positively tell the difference simply by looking at an addr=
ess.<br>
&gt; One needs additional information to say for sure, because ultimately i=
t&#39;s up<br>
&gt; to each link (or maybe even finer granularity).=C2=A0 But for things l=
ike address-to-<br>
&gt; string conversion (&quot;pretty-printing&quot;) purposes, some impleme=
ntations (like<br>
&gt; Windows) do have a random generation algorithm that avoids colliding w=
ith<br>
&gt; the patterns you mention, and do result in a max entropy of ~63 bits.<=
br>
&gt; So far I don&#39;t see any reason the draft needs to discuss this poin=
t though.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Now on to specifics:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - In section 2, I think the analysis pertains to the lifetime of =
a<br>
&gt; &gt; given link so the wording &quot;average lifetime of a device&quot=
; should<br>
&gt; &gt; instead be &quot;average lifetime of a link&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Right, will fix (it&#39;s correct in the equation at top of page 4 but=
 then the text<br>
&gt; below it wasn&#39;t consistent with it).<br>
<br>
</div></div>Done.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; It is worth noting that CoAP servers do not have a &quot;stealth =
mode&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt; According to [RFC7252] a CoAP server MUST respond to an empty<br>
&gt; &gt; Confirmable message with a Reset message.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It&#39;s not worth noting because the same could be said for TCP or HT=
TP or<br>
&gt; ICMP.=C2=A0 The &quot;stealth mode&quot; is a property of a host firew=
all in front of it but on<br>
&gt; the same device.=C2=A0 Section 5 of RFC 7288 (which the draft<br>
&gt; references) already contains a discussion of this point, and just uses=
 TCP and<br>
&gt; ICMP as examples, and that text equally applies to COAP.<br>
<br>
</span>Updated text to discuss firewalls and reword to make it clearer that=
 it&#39;s<br>
about dropping unsolicited inbound traffic before it ever reaches<br>
the TCP/ICMP/COAP/whatever layer, and also mentioned network firewalls<br>
in front of the subnet, that have the same effect.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - In section 3, MS/TP has 7 or 64 bits (since L2 addresses must b=
e in<br>
&gt; &gt; the range 0 - 127).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks, will fix.<br>
<br>
</span>Fixed.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - Section 3.1 seems to alternately switch between discussing<br>
&gt; &gt; link-layer addresses and IIDs formed from those addresses.=C2=A0 =
Perhaps<br>
&gt; &gt; consistent use of &quot;link identifier&quot; and &quot;interface=
 identifier&quot; would<br>
&gt; &gt; help disambiguate the meaning.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Ok, will see what I can do.<br>
<br>
</span>Changed.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; EUI-64 and EUI-48 are well-defined terms (trademarked in fact, an=
d<br>
&gt; &gt; this should be noted in the document).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Why should it be noted?=C2=A0 Can you point me to a 6man RFC (since ma=
ny 6man<br>
&gt; RFCs mention EUI-64 and EUI-48) that notes that the term is trademarke=
d?=C2=A0 Is<br>
&gt; there an RFC style guide directive on such matters?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; An EUI-64 may have 40, 36, or<br>
&gt; &gt; 28 bits of entropy, while an EUI-48 may have 24, 20, or 12 bits, =
none<br>
&gt; &gt; of which meet the standard of &quot;at least 46 bits&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; When the OUI is unknown, the lack of such knowledge provides a few mor=
e<br>
&gt; bits of entropy since the attacker has to at least try any well-known =
OUI&#39;s and<br>
&gt; do a search within each one.=C2=A0 For example, if there&#39;s 64+ pos=
sible OUI&#39;s in<br>
&gt; use, that&#39;s around 6 more bits of entropy.=C2=A0=C2=A0 An off-link=
 attacker cannot,<br>
&gt; without additional information, know what the link type is and so has =
to try<br>
&gt; OUIs without being able to narrow it down to OUI&#39;s for that link t=
ype.<br>
<br>
</span>I also reduced the number of occurrences of the &quot;46 bits&quot; =
number, since that&#39;s<br>
just an example for links that can last 8 years or more.=C2=A0 (Many 6lo li=
nks last<br>
for far less time than that, so we shouldn&#39;t over-index on the number 4=
6,<br>
it&#39;s just an example.=C2=A0 =C2=A0The key point is to derive the number=
 from the max<br>
expected link lifetime.)<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; accurate to use &quot;randomized IEEE identifiers&quot;, unless t=
his refers to<br>
&gt; &gt; locally-assigned MAC addresses with the U/L bit =3D 1, in which c=
ase we<br>
&gt; &gt; might want to reference an appropriate IEEE 802 or ISO standard.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Random MAC addresses was the intent, but &quot;MAC&quot; as a term onl=
y applies to<br>
&gt; specific link types.=C2=A0 Maybe &quot;randomized link-layer addresses=
&quot; is a better<br>
&gt; term, so I&#39;ll use that.<br>
<br>
</span>Done<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - In Section 4, first bullet, it should be enough to indicate tha=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; privacy IIDs are RECOMMENDED for routable addresses.=C2=A0 (Is th=
ere a case<br>
&gt; &gt; where a privacy IID is less than ~63 bits of entropy?)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Such a recommendation may be too strong for some cases (it would indee=
d<br>
&gt; be sufficient, but not necessary).=C2=A0 For example, if the link life=
time is usually<br>
&gt; &lt;1 second, then privacy IIDs might be overkill.=C2=A0 The point of =
the first bullet is<br>
&gt; to say that an IP-over-Foo doc should contain such a discussion.=C2=A0=
 However,<br>
&gt; perhaps your point is that it could say that using privacy addresses i=
s one easy<br>
&gt; way to meet the requirement.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; That is, I don&#39;t believe there is 6lo WG consensus for stating tha=
t privacy IIDs<br>
&gt; are RECOMMENDED for routable addresses.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This section<br>
&gt; &gt; should also discuss options for providing privacy IIDs via DHCPv6=
<br>
&gt; &gt; (M=3D1 in RA).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have no problem adding such a reference.=C2=A0 The point is to say w=
hat privacy<br>
&gt; considerations need to be addressed in a doc, rather than details of *=
how*<br>
&gt; to address them, in order to leave maximum freedom.<br>
&gt; But providing examples as informative references as you suggest is a g=
ood<br>
&gt; thing.<br>
<br>
</span>I checked and there is no reference (RFC or draft) as far as anyone =
I asked knows.<br>
So I didn&#39;t mention DHCPv6 in this document, I left it for 6man documen=
ts<br>
to discuss since it&#39;s not specific to 6lo.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Second bullet - as I&#39;ve indicated above, there&#39;s no such =
thing as a<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;random&quot; EUI-64 or EUI-48.=C2=A0 We can probably use &q=
uot;randomized MAC<br>
&gt; &gt; addresses&quot;.=C2=A0 I need to go back and re-read [RFC7136] to=
 see if it<br>
&gt; &gt; makes sense to specify U/L bit in this context.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Agreed, will use &quot;randomized link-layer addresses&quot;.<br>
<br>
</span>Done<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Third bullet - this advice should not apply to link-local IIDs.=
=C2=A0 Any<br>
&gt; &gt; attacker wishing to find &quot;hits&quot; just needs to fire up a=
 sniffer.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Disagree as noted above.=C2=A0 It applies due to off-link leakage.<br>
&gt; (And the IP-over-Foo layer should not make assumptions about what uppe=
r-<br>
&gt; layer protocols do.)=C2=A0 The risk might be smaller, and hence it mig=
ht apply<br>
&gt; &quot;less&quot;, but it still applies.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Fourth bullet - this advice should not apply to link-local IIDs f=
or<br>
&gt; &gt; devices or applications where correlation of activities over time=
 is not a<br>
&gt; concern.<br>

in that sense.=C2=A0 =C2=A0But either way, the security/privacy text in a d=
raft should address<br>
the issue, whatever the answer is.<br>
<div class=3D"HOEnZb"><div class=3D"h5"><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Again the main point of this draft is not to say what one MUST or MUST=
 NOT<br>
&gt; do (or rather *how* one MUST or MUST NOT solve some privacy issue), bu=
t<br>
&gt; rather what issues need to be addressed in a doc, and some<br>
&gt; recommendations<br>
&gt; (&quot;shoulds&quot;) on good ways to address them.=C2=A0=C2=A0 So the=
 fact that there&#39;s still a risk<br>
&gt; means there&#39;s still a need for text to address them or convincingl=
y (to the<br>
&gt; IETF community and to the IESG) explain why some issue doesn&#39;t app=
ly to a<br>
&gt; particular IP-over-foo mechanism.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks again for the review,<br>
&gt; Dave<br>

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes of the IETF.

        Title           : Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Near Field Communication
        Authors         : Yong-Geun Hong

Abstract:
   Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
   and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other
   by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no
   more than 10 cm.  NFC standards cover communications protocols and
   data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.
   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC
   Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available
   in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This
   document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN
   techniques.

Hi folks,

You can find the agenda at:
https://tools.ietf.org/wg/6lo/agenda

If you're presenting, please send relevant slides ASAP so we can upload to =
the materials page.

Please consider taking notes (main action items and decisions are the most =
important part, not everything that transpires during the meeting) and moni=
toring the jabber room. If so, please let us know in advance of the meeting=
 next Monday.

One very easy way to take notes is to use the etherpad for this meeting. It=
 is available from the agenda URL shown above (look for "etherpad-96" at th=
e top of the page). Any method is fine, of course.

Thanks,

Chairs

Hi Alex,

I think we were experiencing a tools.ietf.org outage.
Works for me now.

All,

We are organizing an information meeting about F-Interop, an online
platform for remote interoperability testing, IETF96 Monday 8.30-9.30pm, in
Charlottenburg I.

F-Interop (www.f-interop.eu) is a platform for online and remote
conformance and interoperability testing, targeted at IoT-related standards
(6TiSCH, 6LoWPAN, CoAP, RPL, ...)

The purpose of this info session is to give you a technical overview of the
platform, describe how the IETF community can use and contribute to it, and
get feedback.

The platform is built as part of the 2016-2018 F-Interop H2020 European
project. As part of that project, we will have an open call for entities to
contribute additional tools and test descriptions to the platform. Selected
projects will be funded; we will explain the process during the info
session as well.

Looking forward to seeing you there,

Thomas

I've now found https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7824#section-4.1
which explains why at least today DHCPv6 is not used for temporary addresse=
s.
Based on that discussion, I'm thinking it's best to keep it out of this doc=
, but
let me know if others disagree (and if so, what text you would suggest afte=
r
reading that short section).

I will ask this during my slot in 6lo.

All,

Please note that the info session is in the EVENING, i.e. 20.30. Some
people got confused.

Also, the Meetecho team is arranging for remote participation [1] to be
possible, thanks to them!

Hi Pascal,

I find this work interesting.
As mentioned in the meeting today, you might want to:

- refer to draft-ietf-intarea-adhoc-wireless-com (currently in WGLC in
intarea) and
- relate more explicitly to what that draft describes w.r.t. partially
overlapping radio scopes, and time varying link membership, for the
link-local mechanism in the proposed rfc6775 update.

Best,

Emmanuel

Hi all,=0A=
   I am considering AD sponsoring the following draft=0A=
=0A=
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kivinen-802-15-ie-02=0A=
=0A=
to request the allocation of an 802.15.4 information element from the IEEE =
=0A=
for use in the IETF protocols that may need it. If you have any concerns =
=0A=
either with the content of the draft or about requesting the IE at all plea=
se =0A=
let me know before 2016/07/29.=0A=
=0A=
Thanks=0A=
Suresh=0A=
=0A=
NOTE: I have CCed: all the groups that I thought could be potentially =0A=
interested in this work. If you think I have missed out some WG(s) please l=
et =0A=
me know.=0A=

Pascal spoke today in 6man concerning the process of providing privacy
enhanced addresses in 6man, and how LLNs typically use their 2-byte short
addresses for layer-2, and also for forming L3 addresses.
Pascal mentioned that 2-byte addresses can be dhcpv6 assigned and therefore
unrelated to the EUI-64.  (Of course, many just use the bottom two bytes of
the EUI-64, and don't do DAD or ND at all.. Let's agree they are not to spec)

I was thinking about the dhcpv6 process.  In order to do it in a route-over
mesh, the route-over mesh needs to be up in order to get traffic to the
DHCPv6 server.  That means that the DAG has been formed using EUI-64 derived
link local addresses.

Afterward, the 6LNs will allocate a 2-byte v6 address from the dhcpv6 server,
and will then set their L2 address based upon that.    I think that this is
not specified anywhere...?

But, the thing that got to write this email (while doing my IETF96 laundry),
is the parent selection process.  Do we need to have a way for an RPL parent
to say in it's DIO, "I know you see me as fe80::1234, but you knew me before
as fe80::1234:56fe:ff78:abcd", such that there could be a seamless and
efficient transition to the new 2-byte addresses?

Perhaps it's good enough that the node, having been allocated a 2-byte L2
address, does a gratitous NA where it announces it's EUI64 LL address with
it's 2-byte L2 address?  How does that sit security-wise?  Have we just
encouraged the network to accept gratuitous L2 address spoofing?

How does this interact with Back-Bone Router EARO processing?

If the transition can be augmented by an ephemeral public key, and some 
parameters, perhaps, in dhcpv6, this could work as you indicated in a 
safe manner.

The rest is my French: Using DHCP to assign them is interesting but beyond =

Dear Behcet and Pascal

I have previously reviewed the draft on address protected neighbor 
discovery: draft-sarikaya-6lo-ap-nd-01.

I generally like the idea but still have some questions. I wonder what 
about collisions for cryptographic IDs. The draft defines them as 
64-bits long. I assume that at a minimum 80 bits are needed to assume 
that it is collision free. Or is it the case that collisions are not an 
issue in this case?

Thanks
/--Mohit

I just ran some numbers through for another problem with a 64bit number 
field.  It works out as follows.

The formula is:  1 - e^{-k^2/(2n)}

Where n is your maximum popluation size (2^64 here, 1.84E19) and K is 
your actual population.

A .01% probablity of a collision is  a bit less than 66M devices.

If everyone in the world has one device (7B), then you are up to a 73% 
probablity of a collision.

So your risk of a collision on a network is there, but really low.

ID author, you may want to put this formula into your draft.

Confirming.  Assuming non storing RPL ... are you thinking the LBR is 
maintaining the DAG with link local addresses?

If we are doing per-link keying, and we transition our address, and we can
propogate the L2-security upwards, then I agree that this transition could be
secured.   I'm still thinking that we might need a L3-RPL level signal
which would be secured.

Thanks Bob!

I think the bottom line here is what's the exposure. If the collision occur=
red on a MAC address that would effectively get packets to the wrong place =
and would partially cut off devices from the network.

No such thing here. The collision has no operational consequence. Both node=
s will register their addresses fine and there will be no visible effect un=
less the IPv6 addresses are also in collision.

Is there a security opening then?

The exposure is that two devices may be capable of claiming one another's a=
ddress and the 6LBR will fail to prevent this, putting us back to today's s=
ituation for these 2 particular devices.=20

Even in the highly remote chance that they are on a same subnetwork, even i=
f one is a really mean device, L2 crypto does not allow node B to see what =
UID is used by device A so those 2 devices will not know they are in this s=
ituation.

It's good to add words to explain all this but the chance of accident are t=
oo remote to be of consequence. Instead we need to focus on getting a CGA t=
hat is hard enough to attack....

Pascal

My numbers show that on a network, the probablity is so small that the 
address is statistically unique.


Even with 50,000 devices on a network, the probably would be 6.67E-9%  
Just not there.

Hi Pascal, Behcet, Mohit and others

I have also read through the draft briefly. It seems interesting and useful=
.

If I understood correctly, you plan to use standard CGA for generating the =
cryptographic IDs. Is this true?

Would you use elliptic curve variants for this instead of RSA that is speci=
fied in RFC 3972? Are there some existing CGA implementations for generatin=
g cryptographic IDs that can be used?

Thanks
Shiva

Don't know how much this would help, but HIPv2 (rfc 7401) specifies how 
to use a ECDSA (e.g. p256) value into ORCHIDv2 (rfc 7343).

No matter how small, there is still some chance of collision so I
think we should deal it in the draft?

Of course, this is all assuming that you really have a true random 
distribution across the 64 bit address space, not getting those bad 
random seeds that UofMich found with SSL server keys. If the resultant 
max population is only 2^32, a 50,000 device deployment has a 25% 
probablity of collision.


So you might also need to say something about the importance of random 
numbers.  Might already need that for other items...


Ya got to love ASSuMEsions.

Suresh,

I strongly support the publication of this document. Since it defines a
mechanism which can be used by several working groups, AD sponsoring seems
perfect.

I'm attaching the XML of the the -02 version of that draft in which I have
corrected some typos. I'll let Tero and Pat decide what he wants to merge,
if anything. These changes are for the authors' information only, they do
NOT affect my support to publish this document.

Thomas

As this will allocate number for the IETF, not for just one WG, the
authors though it would be better to get as wide coverage for it,
meaning having longer last call time, and advertising it in several
different working groups (who might use it in the future), instead of
having it for one WG draft in some WG.

Also it was not clear which WG it should be in. I think 6tisch is the
one who might need it first, but 6lo is most likely also going to
using it etc.

This makes me ask a question about 802.15.9:  would a new KMP created by the
IETF for 15.9 (such as OSCOAP or DTLS) need to use an IE under this subtype?
Or does 15.9 have it's own registry, and if so would we need different liason
request for that?

Hi Michael

IEEE 802.15.9 defines a multiplex ID covered by the IEEE 802.15 ANA.  To def=
ine a new KMP would only require a new annex that describes how the KMP work=
s and an allocation of a new Multiplex ID.

There is also a vendor specific multiplex ID that could be used now without a=
ny written description in IEEE 802.15

The last argument is relatively easy to overcome. As both 6tisch and 6lo be=
long in the INT area, this could be a good candidate for a intarea WG docum=
ent. I also have a slight preference for this path, as a WG document has ty=
pically a better level of scrutiny and review.=20

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes of the IETF.

        Title           : Privacy Considerations for IPv6 over Networks of Resource-Constrained Nodes
        Author          : Dave Thaler
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations-02.txt
	Pages           : 10
	Date            : 2016-07-29

Abstract:
   This document discusses how a number of privacy threats apply to
   technologies designed for IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained
   nodes, and provides advice to protocol designers on how to address
   such threats in adaptation layer specifications for IPv6 over such
   links.


The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is:
