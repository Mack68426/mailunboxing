Hi Erik and all:

Considering that the device access link may be wireless or that the device =
may be operating on batteries, whatever we can do in the infrastructure wou=
ld be welcome.
The Wireless ND SAIL draft allows to propagate a registration up a hierarch=
y of registrars in a mapping system. We could leverage this to implement op=
tion 1 between siblings.
Both drafts will be discussed this morning.

Cheers,

Pascal

Good point - the VRRP case hasn't been worked through.

2b. Explicitly sending the additional registration addresses in a new RA op=

AFAIK there aren't IETF standard protocols for checkpointing, thus #1 would=
 potentially be a lot of work. And it would make the VRRP case quite differ=

Hence I'd be inclined to define the "additional registration addresses"=20

I don't know to what extent VRRP would be used in a wireless case. In a 
case of e.g., 802.11 the device sees a single point of failure in the 
form of the AP.

But allowing a VRRP pair of NEARs to synchronize their registration 
state isn't something that we have to preclude - my observation is that 
we don't have IETF standard protocols which ensure (eventually) 
consistent state in two devices.
The SAIL propagation, as I understand it, is more of a best effort 
approach with a fallback to rely on multicast NS on the backbone link. 
Such a best effort approach is fine in the SAIL context AFAICT, but 
wouldn't help the VRRP case.

Regards,
    Erik

Good point - the VRRP case hasn't been worked through.

For the non-VRRP case of multiple routers the hosts will see that there 
are multiple and register with each one of them. But in the case of VRRP 
it looks to the host as a single router.

I can see three different ways to ensure that NEARs using VRRP can 
maintain all the registrations:
1. A state checkpointing/synchronization protocol between the VRRP NEARs
2. Making the hosts aware that they need to register at two different 
NEAR addresses
2a. A bit of a hack would be to, in addition for the RA from the virtual 
address, have the physical routers send a RA (with the E bit set) with 
the lowest possible preference.
2b. Explicitly sending the additional registration addresses in a new RA 
option.

AFAIK there aren't IETF standard protocols for checkpointing, thus #1 
would potentially be a lot of work. And it would make the VRRP case 
quite different than the case of multiple NEARs not using VRRP.

Hence I'd be inclined to define the "additional registration addresses" 
option.

Hello Erik:

The wireless link fixes itself with re-association to an alternate AP and d=
oing so they would probably reregister.
The problem that I see here is if the change of NEAR with an VRRP group hap=
pens transparently to the device, do we agree?

I don't know to what extent VRRP would be used in a wireless case. In a cas=

But allowing a VRRP pair of NEARs to synchronize their registration state i=

Pascal,

My though it is that a EAH would register (and maintain registration) 
with all the NEAR physical routers which are part of the virtual router. 
That requires that the EAH finds out about about the physical routers 
(in the form of additional registration addresses).

Thus when there is a VRRP failover there is nothing that the EAH would 
need to do; the registrations are already in the new active physical router.

In that model when configuring VRRP on a NEAR router it would make sense 
to also enable sending this new "additional registration addresses" 
option in the RAs. However, if the VRRP group of NEARs has some other 
way to synchronize their state, then they can use that and not send this 
new option in the RAs.

Regards,
    Erik

I interpreted the general feeling in the room to be that this is a
very useful draft that fits well in the charter, and people seemed to
be in favor of WG adoption. There were some concerns about modularity
of the MIB module, in particular once we have the other IP-over-foo
documents, e.g., would we require a common part of the 6lowpan MIB
module and then optional parts of the MIB module for each type of
technologies?


We would like to see some discussion and hopefully some reviews of the
draft with that in mind. Ideally, I want to ask for WG adoption in
beginning of December, of course depending on the discussion.

So far, I do not see a technical reason to split the module or
something like that. Concerning the mesh counters, I propose to make
them conditionally mandatory.

In MIB modules, it is possible to group a number of objects and to
organize the conformance statement in such a way that the counters are
mandatory only if a certain feature is implemented (mesh header
processing in this case). In other boxes, implementations such as
Contiki that do not do mesh header processing would be compliant
without implementing any of the counters. We might leave a counter,
though, to count the frames with mesh headers receveid that were
dropped.

It would be useful for the roadmap to explain what the various building
blocks that 6lowpan/6man defined (HC, fragletation, DAD, efficient-ND,etc.)
and what the dependancies between them are.  Which ones can one use
without bringing in other bits.

You mean in the sense of a guide for people defining new 6LoWPANs for =
new radios?
We had some hallway discussions about creating such a guide, including =
=93what MAC features should I put in to be most useful for a 6LoWPAN=94.
We probably want to keep such a spec developers guide separate from the =
implementers=92 guide the current roadmap is, to reduce confusion.

I have just posted revision -01. Next to some wording changes, I
have made the mesh counters conditionally mandatory. Find the

Hi Ulrich,

Agree we should adopt the draft.

A couple of points that I think need clarification:
1)  6lobac applies only to the master (essentially, as I understood it
from the presentation yesterday, the slaves stay as MS/TP only devices
without IPv6 support)
2)  Whether there are any ND implications (I believe the native MS/TP
addresses are just 16 bits......)

Don

Hi Samita,

Hopefully we won't forget the topic of ND for "IPv6 over foo".   I found
that topic to be the most intertwined with address assignment and even the
way the underlying layer 2 technology operates over a given topology......

Right, that is something that a roadmap for IP-over-foo developers might =
want to address.

So far, the selection criteria seems to be rather obvious, though:
We have one wired protocol that went with ND-classic and four wireless =
ones that went with RFC 6775 (ARO option).

If we need to develop RFC 6775 further, that would certainly be =
something we need to closely coordinate with 6man, which is also =
developing RFC 6775 further to enable it to work in environments that =
have legacy ND-classic nodes (=93Efficient ND=94).

Hi Ulrich,

Agree that the draft should be adopted by the WG.  Hereis one few point
that I think need some attention:
1)  Rationalizing use of ghc where the PDU size of the underlying
technology varies from as small as 40 bytes up to nearly 1280 bytes

Don

The third paragraph in section 1.3 states

  Slave nodes transmit only when polled and are not considered
  part of this specification.

 2)  Whether there are any ND implications (I believe the native MS/TP
> addresses are just 16 bits......)
>
> The unicast address mapping used by ND is spelled out in section 8
and is identical to the mapping used by RFC 4944 for short 802.15.4
MAC addresses.

Hope that clarifies these two points.

[sorry duplicate, corrected the destination address]

Hello 6lo-ers,

I would like to mention the existence of an IPv6-over-80211p document
that I co-author:

draft-petrescu-ipv6-over-80211p-00.txt
"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.11p Networks"
A. Petrescu, R. Kuntz, P. Pfister, N. Benamar

It has received a number of comments from IEEE participants as well as
IETF participants.  But we still need a home for it.

The 802.11p link is related to constrained environments, in the following:
- a high mobility aspect as an inherent characteristic of
   vehicles
- onboard networks although not running 80211p themeselves, are
   typically connected to 80211p networks ran between vehicles, or
   between a vehicle and another fixed unit.

Without derailing WG focus, may I ask you to comment on this draft?

Alex

Alex,
     Does your draft leverage the 6lowpan RFCs?  If not, I would suggest
talking to 6man.

Regards,
Brian

Alex,

after a quick glance on your draft, it seems to me that you do not use
the 6lowpan adaptation layer, so it would be out of charter for 6lo
(but possibly in scope of 6man). The relevant part of our charter is:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of
interest in constrained node networks


Regards
Ulrich

Hello Brian,

Yes, I will mention this draft to 6man, thanks for the suggestion.

No, this draft does not leverage 6lowpan RFCs.  (although links could be
found, such as IPv6-over-802154 RFC would supposedly run over a part of
an unknown Ethernet-80211 adaptation layer that IPv6-over-80211p draft
describes.)

Hello Ulrich,

Yes, the Charter says so.  Thanks for the clarification.

Alex

Alex,

after a quick glance on your draft, it seems to me that you do not use
the 6lowpan adaptation layer, so it would be out of charter for 6lo
(but possibly in scope of 6man). The relevant part of our charter is:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of
interest in constrained node networks


Regards
Ulrich

Abstract:
   BLUETOOTH Low Energy is a low power air interface technology defined
   by the BLUETOOTH Special Interest Group (BT-SIG).  The standard
   BLUETOOTH radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile
   phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other devices.
   The low power version of BLUETOOTH is a new specification that
   enables the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors,
   smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low power variant of BLUETOOTH is
   currently specified in the revision 4.0 of the BLUETOOTH
   specifications (BLUETOOTH 4.0).  This document describes how IPv6 is
   transported over BLUETOOTH Low Energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Hi Carsten,

I think Don brought up an important point in terms of 6lowpan-nd over diffe=
rent radio technologies.

Based on the current 6lowpan-nd(RFC 6775)  we can separate out different co=
mponents (multicast reduction, DAD or no-DAD, single-hop, multi-hop, 64-bit=
 MAC-address and  less-than 64-bit MAC address etc. etc. ) and when each of=
 these components are useful.

So, I'd assume these kind of discussions belong to  the general guideline d=
ocuments. [ speaking as a co-author of RFC6775]

As for extending RFC6775,   I am sure there should be opportunities to exte=
nd it as we come up with more usecases with SLAAC.


Thanks,
-Samita

Right, that is something that a roadmap for IP-over-foo developers might wa=
nt to address.

So far, the selection criteria seems to be rather obvious, though:
We have one wired protocol that went with ND-classic and four wireless ones=
 that went with RFC 6775 (ARO option).

If we need to develop RFC 6775 further, that would certainly be something w=

These are the kind of general guideline would be useful.

Since 6LoBAC is using part of RFC4944 and part of IPHC implementation, it c=
an also do the part of RFC 6775.
6CO is defined in RFC6775. In your case the network depth is only one hop.

Thanks,

Right.  What I was saying is that it may be a good idea to separate the =
advice for implementers from the advice for designers of new =
subnetworks.

So I would make that two documents, one the 6lo[wpan] roadmap, and one a =

As per milestone, the general guideline doc is due after March. But we shou=
ld be able to start discussion now..
Thanks Carsten to intiate. I'd be happy to contribute on the generic guidel=

Subject: dinner consensus on trickle-mcast and multicast-scoopes


(I didn't have time to write a shorter note) (Resending because I got the 6=
man list address wrong. Wish there was an alias)

glossary for 6man readers:
      RPL =3D ROLL RFC6550 mesh-over routing protocol.
      MPL =3D ROLL draft-ietf-trickle-mcast multicast distribution
            protocol.

This email is a bit long, but represents what I believe was the consensus t=
hat was arrived at by a number of ROLL WG ID authors, some Zigbee IP expert=
s, and Ralph.  This consensus was arrived at slowly over Tuesday night and =
Wednesday, and was brought to you by the letters B and I. =20

I will start with the executive summary:

1) there are some minor tweaks necessary to trickle-mcast to make
   it consistent with multicast-scopes, and to indicate that=20
   encapsulation in scopes 4 and 5 are appropriate for some use cases

2) that the text in multicast-scopes that speaks of "administratively
   defined" is confusing to many, and a suggestion on different text
   will be posted in a reply to this email.

=3D=3D=3D background and discussion

Trickle-mcast must use/define scope 3 in order to get traffic to flow
across the entire RPL LLN (mesh-over).   The current multicast-scopes
document makes scope 3 span all the interfaces of the nodes of a single ins=
tance of a technology.  The intention was that IP-over-FOO documents would =
explain how this is defined, with the understanding that for
802.15.4 it would span all interfaces which are in a single PAN-ID.

RPL, however, can and does run over many different link types, and there ar=
e existing deployed systems that have mixes of 802.15.4/802.15.4G/802.11*/8=
02.3(wired), in some cases, with the
technologies even alternating on a hop by hop basis.   Both Zigbee IP,
metering and home systems need to span multiple technologies for multicast,=
 and Zigbee IP SEP 2 specifies using multicast to do service discovering us=
ing mDNS. =20

Many want to automatically configure a multicast scope to cover all of the =
interfaces which are part of an RPL DODAG and/or that an address in
the same (multi-link subnet) prefix.   There was many months of
confusing discussion about having this be the definition of scope 3, but th=
e alternate view was that MPL was not tied to RPL, and that neither the DOD=
AG nor the prefix were inherent physical properties of the network in the w=
ay that a set of cables and a switch or a radio with a specific PANID.

The origin of the second mis-understanding was that the text in multicast-s=
copes (and rfc 4291) says:

         Admin-Local scope is the smallest scope that must be
         administratively configured, i.e., not automatically derived

The understanding of "administratively configured" for many people implies =
truck rolls, or ssh logins or router CLI commands.  It was only when this a=
ssumption was clearly articulated that the origin of the conflict became cl=
ear to all parties.

The new understanding is that "administratively configured" is not limited =
to the things that a human did it, but rather includes any processes or ope=
rations that a human (including an IETF document) might
cause.   The intent of multicast-scopes is not to limit ways that=20
scopes 4+ can be determined, but to clarify that scopes <=3D3 are *not* int=
ended to be defined by a physical (or physical-like) topologies.

To put it another way, a human, looking at some non-virtualized equipement =
likely can determine the extent of scope 1,2,3 even if there is no power co=
nnected.

The conclusion was that the group reached was that scope 3 can be defined o=
n a per-technology basis, and in wireless links such as
the 802.15.4 PANID.   Where exactly to define this is still an open
question, but we did conclude that the place is *not* in trickle-mcast.
We are undecided if we need another worlds-shortest-RFC on 805.15.4 (effect=
ively a 6lowpan/6lo/6man document) vs in multicast-scopes, but another RFC =
is preferred by most. (Perhaps; all)=20

In another place, to be determined, possibly in applicability statements, o=
r possibly in an application specific document (e.g. something like "mdns-o=
ver-lln"), a process by which a scope 4 multicast boundary could be defined=
 to be something like the set of all interfaces which are in at least one D=
ODAG.

It should fall to homenet to define scope 5 for use in the home to cover th=
e set of interfaces which are in the inside of the homenet.  This should be=
 easy for homenet to articulate discover of the homenet
boundary is already a work item.    The LLN border router would be
speaking homenet routing protocol on the interface that connects it to the =
homenet, and would include the LLN scope 4 zone as part of the scope
5 homenet.

This implies that LLNs will be using scope 5 to do mDNS resolution, and tha=
t this packet will be carried through the LLNs various links
encapsulated into a scope 3 packet.   While it is likely that dnssd will
not solve the multi-subnet problem using straight multicast, but rather usi=
ng a proxy mechanism, use of scope 5 is agnostic to exactly how this would =
be done.
A mote that wishes to resolve only within the LLN may use scope 3 or 4, whi=
le one that wants to possibly find things in any place of the home will use=
 scope 5. =20

This revision adds the definition of "scop 3" for IEEE 802.15.4 networks:

4.  Definition of Realm-Local Scope for IEEE 802.15.4

   When used in an IP-over-IEEE802.15.4 network, "scop 3" is defined to
   include all interfaces sharing a PAN ID.

I've cross-posted to 6lo to get review and comment from that WG.

- Ralph

Hello Ralph:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-droms-6man-multicast-scopes-02 does not se=
em to contains the section you're inlining. The only diff I found was -spec=
ific going -local.
As we are at it, would we be ahead of ourselves if that the draft also spec=
ifies that a collection of RPL DODAGs of a same instance federated over an =
isolated backbone (such as a VLAN) in an 04 ?.

If I may add, there is kind of an habit that scopes are nested. Seems that =
we are going away from that assumption and maybe it would be good to have a=
 sentence saying that?

Cheers,
Pascal

Scopes are still nested.  See RFC 4007.  Are you saying that this

Hello Brian:

03 seems to derive from autonomic behavior, whereas 04 derives from admin. =
I do not see there a direct indication that 03 is contained in 04 though in=
 the deployments I have in mind it would certainly be the case. Whether we =
want to enforce or on the contrary do not want to enforce the nesting is pr=
obably something we want to clarify.

Cheers

Pascal

Are there use cases documented somewhere in a 6lo or 6lo-related draft?

I'm interested as we're updating the homenet text about multicast =

it's interesting because we may, indeed are likely to, have 6lo networks =

Pascal,
    Scope 3 being contained within scope4 is mandated by RFC 4007.
Specifically, RFC 4007 describes the following properties:

o  Zone boundaries cut through nodes, not links.  (Note that the global
zone has no boundary, and the boundary of an interface-local zone
encloses just a single interface.)

o  Zones of the same scope cannot overlap; i.e., they can have no links
or interfaces in common.

o  A zone of a given scope (less than global) falls completely within
zones of larger scope.  That is, a smaller scope zone cannot include
more topology than would any larger scope zone with which it shares any
links or interfaces.

o  Each zone is required to be "convex" from a routing perspective;
i.e., packets sent from one interface to any other in the same zone are
never routed outside the zone.  Note, however, that if a zone contains a
tunneled link (e.g., an IPv6-over-IPv6 tunnel link [8]), a lower layer
network of the tunnel can be located outside the zone without breaking
the convexity property.


I don't see anything in this draft that would change those properties.

Regards,
Brian

Hello Tim;

The 6TiSCH architecture documents a use case whereby a large (RPL based) LL=
N is federated by an higher speed backbone such as Ethernet that mostly spa=
ns the LLN.
The LLN is partitioned by RPL in multiple DODAGs, and the roots of the DODA=
Gs connect to the backbone to provide end to end connectivity over the form=
ed multilink subnet.
The LLN probably forms a single RPL Domain though we have not discussed tha=
t yet. Discussing with Ralph, I understand that the RPL domain is 03 and th=
e whole multilink subnet is 04.
It results that we cannot address a single RPL instance or a single DODAG a=
s a scope. The intersection with 802.15.4 PAN-ID still troubles me a bit bu=
t that's another thread.=20

Cheers,

Pascal

Are there use cases documented somewhere in a 6lo or 6lo-related draft?

I'm interested as we're updating the homenet text about multicast scopes.  =
We have agreed some text in principle with Brian for that, but it's interes=

IPv6 home networks.

I mostly agree Brian;

It's a bit touchy because in 802.15.4 a PAN ID is configured administrative=
ly and could lead to an 04 interpretation.=20
A RPL domain (that is an 03) that may span multiple PAN IDs. If PAN ID was =
04 that would have been reverse nesting.=20
The draft now clarifies that this is also an 03 but now we still have a pot=
ential conflict between a RPL domain and a PAN.

Would a RPL domain be constrained by the PAN ID?=20

In this case that would imply that all the LLN must always be a single PAN =
and constrain the size of a subnet to 64K.
There is a lot behind the sentence "care must be taken in the definition of=
 those larger scopes to ensure that inclusion constraint is met."=20

Cheers;
Pascal

ast-scopes-02.txt

Pascal,
    Scope 3 being contained within scope4 is mandated by RFC 4007.
Specifically, RFC 4007 describes the following properties:

o  Zone boundaries cut through nodes, not links.  (Note that the global zon=
e has no boundary, and the boundary of an interface-local zone encloses jus=
t a single interface.)

o  Zones of the same scope cannot overlap; i.e., they can have no links or =
interfaces in common.

o  A zone of a given scope (less than global) falls completely within zones=
 of larger scope.  That is, a smaller scope zone cannot include more topolo=
gy than would any larger scope zone with which it shares any links or inter=
faces.

o  Each zone is required to be "convex" from a routing perspective; i.e., p=
ackets sent from one interface to any other in the same zone are never rout=
ed outside the zone.  Note, however, that if a zone contains a tunneled lin=
k (e.g., an IPv6-over-IPv6 tunnel link [8]), a lower layer network of the t=
unnel can be located outside the zone without breaking the convexity proper=
ty.


I don't see anything in this draft that would change those properties.

Regards,
Brian

Indeed, Section 4 talks about the realm-local scope for IEEE 802.15.4

"4.  Definition of Realm-Local Scope for IEEE 802.15.4

   When used in an IP-over-IEEE802.15.4 network, "scop 3" is defined to
   include all interfaces sharing a PAN ID."

In several places, I think there is a typo: s/scop /scope

How about adding one or two examples in the appendix section  to clarify th=
e nested scope in the home-network  containing two types of networks (wifi =
and LLN) ? Perhaps, we expecting that LLN could have further division in sc=
ope -- ie, IEEE 802.15.4 or BT-le or MS/TP networks.

The example of mdns, rpl, and nd  possibly will fall in different scopes.=20

Thanks,
-Samita

Hi Tim,

 >Are there use cases documented somewhere in a 6lo or 6lo-related draft?

 >I'm interested as we're updating the homenet text about multicast scopes.=
  We have agreed some text in principle with Brian for that, but it's inter=
esting because we may, indeed are likely to, have 6lo networks within futur=
e IPv6 home networks.

[SC>] AFAIK,  6lo/6lowpan basic documents do not discuss the multicast scop=
es in details.=20
[SC>] It'll be certainly helpful to document the scopes of 6lo within the s=
cope of home networks or equivalent.
In addition I think, it'd be really helpful for implementers if we provide =
some examples of scopes of different protocols in the 6man-multicast-scopes=
 doc along with the pointer to RFC 4007.

Thanks,
-Samita

Pascal - RPL domains are, in my opinion, completely unrelated to MPL scopes=
.  RPL is only mentioned obliquely, as an example of a protocol that accomm=
odates the memory constraints in highly constrained devices.  So, I don't t=
hink there is any reason to say "A RPL domain (that is an 03)".

No ... RPL domain is independent of MPL scope.

As a practical matter, a "RPL domain" is a little tricky to define, and eve=
n trickier to tie into a multicast scope.  There is nothing in the multicas=
t address or the MPL header to tie it to a DODAG or some other RPL domain i=
dentifier.  In a mesh where multiple DODAGS and RPL domains may be interlea=
ved, there doesn't seem to be a way to identify a MPL scope.

>=20

I think you're confusing the use of "scop 3" for carrying multicast traffic=
 via MPL across a single mesh network and the use of, e.g., "scop 4" for th=
e scope of, say, mDNS for DNS-SD across a federation of subnets.

I won't attempt the ASCII art here ... but here's an example scenario as I =
understand it: SEP2.0 DNS-SD/mDNS queries intended to span a federation of =
subnets is sent to (working from memory) FC04::FB.  When delivered to an LB=
R at the border of a 6LoWPAN mesh, that query would be encapsulated in FC03=
::<ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS> to carry it across the mesh. Similarly, a query from=
 a mesh node would have an inner header with dst FC04::FB and encapsulated =
by the source with outer header dst FC03::<ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS>; then the MP=
L outer header would be taken off by the LBR and inner DNS-SD/mDNS query wo=
uld be forwarded out any other interfaces based on the dst FC04::FB.

> There is a lot behind the sentence "care must be taken in the definition =

OK, but I don't think draft-ietf-6man-multicast-scopes contradicts RFC 4007=
 in any way.

One could take that argument to the extreme and say that selecting SSID
(802.11) or plugging into a wall socket
(802.3) is an administrative act.  Let's not be too literal and instead say
that the "automatic" zone boundary
definition applies to an existing LAN.  If you think about a Link-Local
zone, it is defined as a set of physically
connected interfaces and the zone boundary is defined by a *lack* of
forwarding (see [RFC4291] section 2.5.6).
I think if there is a need for scope value 3 it is to provide classic
Link-Local multicast behavior over a connected
mesh.  I think the definition should be independent of RPL and instead
depend on some "L2 instance" definition.
PAN ID works for 802.15.4 networks.

A RPL domain (that is an 03) that may span multiple PAN IDs.


draft-ietf-6man-multicast-scopes-02 defines a scop 3 zone boundary based on
PAN ID.  The latest version
makes no mention at all of RPL.

If PAN ID was 04 that would have been reverse nesting.

under certain circumstances, policy
can count as "administratively configured".  Thus, if a RPL instance
contained several PAN IDs then the
former could be used as the basis of a scop 4 zone as long as if fully
enclosed the PANs (scop 3 zones).
OTOH, if a given PAN contains multiple RPL instances then the latter cannot
be used to define a scop 4
zone boundary because that would violate the RFC 4007 constraints that
Brian enumerated.

I offer this definition: an independant outside observer can determine the
boundaries of scope 3 (2, and 1) can be observed without knowledge of the
internal policies of a node.  That's why we can say that it is automatically
defined: there is no choice to make or policy to apply.

This is obvious with a wired network: you just follow the wires.
(The nodes/machines don't even need to be on.)
For a wireless network, you need to have a radio to sniff with, but given
that, you can mostly determine things.

scope 4 is the first scope where a policy *may* come into play.

The thing that broke up the log jam last week was the understanding that
policies may be administratively defined such that the device can make a
decision on it's own, but that this decision is not necessarily visible to =
an
external observer.

(insert reference to Heisenburg uncertainty principle, and Einstein's hidden
variables if you like)

(I need to follow up to Kerry's reply from last week. I'm not sure that
Pascal read it)

No, that's not quite right.

Scope-3 is each of the LLNs that have a single technology instance (e.g. 802.15.4 + PANID)

Scope-4 is the whole multilink subnet as defined by the span of the
collection of DODAGs (my suggestion)

The RPL DODAG instances would likely span the backbone, and would be the
basis for scope-4 configuration.

<RCC>MPL is orthogonal to RPL DODAGs. If there is a requirement to reach =

all nodes in a RPL DODAG which spans multiple 802.15.4 PANs, then that=20
would be administratively configured and scope 4. If a RPL DODAG is=20
wholly contained within the PAN ID then there would need to be some=20
additional discriminator to limit propagation among a node set smaller=20
than that of all nodes with the same PAN ID. In other words, it cannot=20
be limited by just scope, which is too coarse a measurement. MPL doesn't =

cater for this as MPL Domains are defined as scope zones.</RCC>

            <div>I think the understanding that was reached at dinner
              last week is that, under certain circumstances, policy<br>
              can count as "administratively configured".&nbsp; Thus, if =
a
              RPL instance contained several PAN IDs then the<br>
              former could be used as the basis of a scop 4 zone as long
              as if fully enclosed the PANs (scop 3 zones).<br>
            </div>
            <div>OTOH, if a given PAN contains multiple RPL instances
              then the latter cannot be used to define a scop 4<br>
            </div>
            <div>zone boundary because that would violate the RFC 4007

    &lt;RCC&gt;MPL is orthogonal to RPL DODAGs. If there is a
    requirement to reach all nodes in a RPL DODAG which spans multiple
    802.15.4 PANs, then that would be administratively configured and
    scope 4. If a RPL DODAG is wholly contained within the PAN ID then
    there would need to be some additional discriminator to limit
    propagation among a node set smaller than that of all nodes with the
    same PAN ID. In other words, it cannot be limited by just scope,
    which is too coarse a measurement. MPL doesn't cater for this as MPL
    Domains are defined as scope zones.&lt;/RCC&gt;

                  &nbsp; &nbsp; Scope 3 being contained within scope4 is =
mandated
                  by RFC 4007.<br>
                  Specifically, RFC 4007 describes the following
                  properties:<br>
                  <br>
                  o &nbsp;Zone boundaries cut through nodes, not links.
                  &nbsp;(Note that the global zone has no boundary, and t=
he
                  boundary of an interface-local zone encloses just a
                  single interface.)<br>
                  <br>
                  o &nbsp;Zones of the same scope cannot overlap; i.e., t=
hey
                  can have no links or interfaces in common.<br>
                  <br>
                  o &nbsp;A zone of a given scope (less than global) fall=
s
                  completely within zones of larger scope. &nbsp;That is,=
 a
                  smaller scope zone cannot include more topology than
                  would any larger scope zone with which it shares any
                  links or interfaces.<br>
                  <br>
                  o &nbsp;Each zone is required to be "convex" from a rou=
ting
                  perspective; i.e., packets sent from one interface to
                  any other in the same zone are never routed outside
                  the zone. &nbsp;Note, however, that if a zone contains =
a
                  tunneled link (e.g., an IPv6-over-IPv6 tunnel link
                  [8]), a lower layer network of the tunnel can be
                  located outside the zone without breaking the
                  convexity property.<br>

                  I don't see anything in this draft that would change

                  &gt; 03 seems to derive from autonomic behavior,

                  the deployments I have in mind it would certainly be
                  the case. Whether we want to enforce or on the

                  probably something we want to clarify.<br>

                  does not seem to contains the section you're inlining.
                  The only diff I found was -specific going -local.<br>
                  &gt;&gt;&gt; As we are at it, would we be ahead of
                  ourselves if that the draft also specifies that a
                  collection of RPL DODAGs of a same instance federated
                  over an isolated backbone (such as a VLAN) in an 04 ?.<=

                  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
                  &gt;&gt;&gt; If I may add, there is kind of an habit
                  that scopes are nested. Seems that we are going away
                  from that assumption and maybe it would be good to
                  have a sentence saying that?<br>
