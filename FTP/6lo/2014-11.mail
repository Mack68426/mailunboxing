In Hawaii, there will be a BOF about a multicast forwarding control
scheme where a router on the way prefixes a multicast packet with a
special header that tells downtree routers where to forward the
multicast =E2=80=94 Bit Index Explicit Replication, or BIER.

While BIER appears to be very focused on a carrier or datacenter
perspective (see draft-kumar-bier-use-cases and the other
draft-*-bier-*), there are applications in constrained node networks
that would benefit from source-routed multicast.

Several proposals on how to do source-routed multicast in constrained
node networks are getting ready for consumption.

With its current focus, I don=E2=80=99t think the BIER BOF itself is the ri=
ght
place to have a technical discussion about this.
There is no ROLL meeting in Hawaii.
The 6lo agenda is almost full.
Should we do this in a side meeting?  (If we do this before Tuesday, we
can at least report in 6lo =E2=80=94 if we do it on Sunday, we might even h=
ave
an opinion to air during the BIER BOF.)

I take your point.

On the contrary, I think it is important at a BOF for this topic to be
brought up, if ONLY for it to be CLEARLY ruled out of scope.

    > The 6lo agenda is almost full.

ROLL would have to be rechartered to work on it; this is not to say that th=
is
could not happen, but rather to say that even if we were meeting, discussing
it might be out of scope anyway.

Having said that, this thread is most welcome.

I abhor "side meetings" --- either have a proper BOF in a room, or get a
bunch of beers is my opinion.

> Just one clarification, BIER is not Source-Routed multicast. i.e. we =

packet is to be sent.

Indeed, that=92s why I titled this E-mail =93Source-Routed Multicast=94 =
so it is clear it is not the same as BIER.  Source-routing is important =
for RPL=92s non-storing mode, where intermediate routers just don=92t =
know what is below them.  (BIER could be applied to RPL=92s storing =
mode, but then that already has a multicast approach written up, and =
it=92s also not that clear that storing mode actually exists.  The next =
question would then be whether RPL networks are stable enough to have a =
stable egress router numbering applied to them.)

It seems several people would be able to make a Sunday hallway chat =
about this general approach.  Since I=92m officially at a couple of =
meetings (in parallel) from 1600, how about 1500?

State  in BIER (one bitmap per child) is so limited and controlled that a c=
onstrained node that cannot do storing may be able to still do BIER. For su=
ch devices, we could propose a new mode of operation for RPL that is BIER o=
nly, for both unicast and multicast traffic.

If the preferred parent tree is acceptable for downward traffic, the DAOs w=
ould percolate up by ORing the bitmaps of the children and passing that to =
the preferred parent. Decision to forward down to a child (or of a child to=
 process an incoming message) would be a simple AND of the bitmap in the pa=
cket and that of the child, regardless of unicast or multicast.

Cheers,

Pascal

The 6man WG is considering publication of the document "Recommendation on S=
table IPv6 Interface Identifiers", draft-ietf-6man-default-iids.  It will b=
e discussed in the 6man WG meeting in Hawaii.  As the adoption of this docu=
ment as a Standard would have a direct effect on header compression documen=
ts published by 6lo, it is important that we get review of the document by =
6lo WG participants.

I published my comments about draft-ietf-6man-default-iids here: http://www=
.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ipv6/current/msg21378.html

Please review the document and publish any comments to the 6man mailing lis=
t.

- Ralph

Hi Ralph:

Addressing will be discussed during the 6lo session (Tue 9-11.30am), see 
https://tools.ietf.org/wg/6lo/agenda.

FYI - my own presentation was triggered by having a closer look at IPv6 
addressing schemes, history, and, e.g., the draft-ietf-default-iids01 
document. I share your concerns.

{Happy to discuss this topic in person - please drop me a private note 
when/where to meet}

Best regards, Rene

Hi Carsten,

The ROLL case looks very interesting.

Just one clarification, BIER is not Source-Routed multicast. i.e. we =
don=92t include a list of hops that the packet needs to follow, we only =
include final destination in the form of Bit Positions, and each router =
along the path does a lookup on the Bit Position to determine where the =
packet is to be sent.

Thx,

Ice.

I have a few comments on draft-ietf-6lo-dect-ule-00.  Additional review and=
 comment welcome... =20

Content:

I'm curious about why the specification goes in to specifics about the use =
of various forms of RFC 6282 header compression.  Would it be sufficient to=
 specify that IPv6-over-DECT ULE uses RFC 6282 header compression and leave=
 it to the deployment to choose the forms of compression in use?  Are there=
 any details about the use of RFC 6282 header compression that should be no=
ted as specific to IPv6-over-DECT ULE.

In section 3.2.4, does this document specify that the link-local IPv6 addre=
sses are to be entirely elided, or compressed (which turns out to be elided=
 except for the RFC 6282 header bits)?

This document may need to make some mention of draft-ietf-6man-default-iids=
, depending on the progress of that document through the 6man WG.

Editorial:

In section 3.2.3, the use of "unicast" and "multicast" wasn't clear to me; =
specifically when do those terms apply to L2 and L3.

Section 2.1, para 5: s/Depending of/Depending on/

Section 3.2, para 1: I suggest simply writing out FAR rather than using the=
 abbreviation.

Perhaps define 6LBR and 6LN in section 1.2 rather than in-line?

Hi,

I write to endorse draft-rizzo-6lo-6legacy-02. This seems the better
solution presented until now to introduce the legacy devices into the IoT,
this way to do it, which follows the stateless address autoconfiguration
mechanism, provides a huge facility to introduce Non-IP devices to the IoT.
In this sense, I feel this RFC goes in the right direction.

The only drawback I see is the workload that can suffer the "gateway" to
handle thousand of legacy devices (eg in a factory). But this issue could
be managed by using "load balancers".

Best Regards,
David

With the I-D embargo lifted, I finally was able to post our I-D.

Enjoy at:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bergmann-bier-ccast

If anybody wants me to talk about this at BIER, I also have slides.

    &gt;&gt; deprecate the use of 15.4 short addressing...the transient n=
ature of
    &gt;&gt; these addresses seems to aggravate an already pressing issue=
 with
    &gt;&gt; nodes in the LLN changing their IP address frequently.

    &gt; This made me curious &#8212; is a need to deprecate short (16-bi=
t) addresses
    &gt; a widely held opinion?  I&#8217;m hearing this view for the firs=
t time.

Me too.

Those on the scene may want to follow today's discussion in 6lo.

Hi Pascal,

First of all, thanks to all the contributors to this work in producing=20
this draft expediently.

My opinions on the approaches:

_Greedy_

Unacceptable to grab such a large portion of the NHC space. It sets the=20
wrong precedent and limits future enhancements.

_Conservative_

This is the most consistent with RFC6282 and current processing in that=20
it add the occurrence of a single NHC type to indicate the presence of=20
RPI_NHC compressed header. The one downside is that it uses one of the=20
two remaining options in the standard NHC encoding. So whilst this only=20
grabs 1/256 of the space, it only leaves one further possible use.=20
Furthermore, RPI_NHC is not actually an IPv6 Extension Header, it simply =

represents an option in a Hop-by-Hop Options header. The compression=20
applied to RPI_NHC highly specific unlike the general compression=20
applied to an IPv6 Extension Header and therefore the RPI_NHC would=20
require a specific case in NHC compression and decompression.

One possible alternative to consider might be to allocate a new type of=20
NHC; let's call it Specific LOWPAN_NHC:

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                      | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |    EID    |NH |
                      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    EID: Specifically compressed header ID:

       0: Compressed RPL Option (RPI_NHC) [RFCthis]

This could go into RFC6282 as such with the text that the defining RFC=20
MUST explain the compression and decompression mechanism.

The obvious disadvantage is that it takes a larger portion of the NHC=20
space (1/32) but it makes actual NHC processing more straightforward.

_Efficient_

It is clear that in normal cases, it is as efficient as the greedy=20
approach. Whilst the RPI_NHC option occupies 1/4 of the space of the=20
greedy option (i.e. 1/16, which is still quite a bit), the escape option =

occupies another 1/64 of the space. However, occurrence of the escape=20
code complicates processing. Moreover (and I know this has been=20
discussed before), the length of the overall compressed option can=20
change from hop to hop, which it won't do in the case where the normal=20
Hop-by-Hop Options header is used.

Question - any reason the value 010001XY was chosen for the escape code?

_Conclusion_

Firstly, greedy is out for me - it grabs too much space.

If the overriding requirement is to save as many bytes as possible, the=20
efficient approach would be the best choice. It is not clear to me=20
whether the possible length changing has any implications but it could=20
clearly cause fragmentation, which seems undesirable, especially if=20
mechanisms to forward indivdual fragments are being considered.

I think the cost of having one byte for the extra NHC is not a huge cost =

and provides consistent packet sizing therefore I favour the=20
conservative approach. I would also possibly consider the remarks made=20
regarding the different type of subsequent header.

Note that the escape space is not taken just for RFC 6553 compression; =
it can be used for encoding other NHCs as well.

The idea was to reserve some space around that so if we want to extend =
the escape space for some future NHC, we can do so while keeping it =
contiguous.

Note also that RFC 6282 already has variable length processing for hop =
limit and address compression, so the impact of adding a third instance =
is going to be limited.  (I need to write that up some more in =
draft-*-lwig-6lo.)

Since just about every data packet in a RPL network will carry an RPI, =
saving a single byte is worth quite some effort.

        URL:        https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7400.txt

RFC 6282 defines header compression in 6LoWPAN packets (where
"6LoWPAN" refers to "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
Network").  The present document specifies a simple addition that
enables the compression of generic headers and header-like payloads,
without a need to define a new header compression scheme for each
such new header or header-like payload.

This document is a product of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard.

STANDARDS TRACK: This document specifies an Internet Standards Track
protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the Official
Internet Protocol Standards (https://www.rfc-editor.org/standards) for the 
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this 
memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF-Announce and rfc-dist lists.

<RCC>Yes, I realise that one escape code can escape 2 bits of=20
information from the succeeding NHC and that text for the NHC itself=20
must describe how the preceding escape code(s) 2 bits are used. I think=20
some extra explanatory text plus some guidance on choosing what data you =

might want to escape (i.e. that which is normally steady state and=20
changes exceptionally) might help as it isn't immediately obvious.</RCC>

the escape space for some future NHC, we can do so while keeping it conti=
guous.
<RCC>OK, understood</RCC>

limit and address compression, so the impact of adding a third instance i=
s going to be limited.  (I need to write that up some more in draft-*-lwi=
g-6lo.)
<RCC>I don't see any issue where the IPv6 packet is reassembled every=20
hop. I was wondering if there might be an issue in the case of fragment=20
forwarding although with RPL (i.e. route over), I am not sure if=20
fragment forwarding is actually possible anyway, so it may not be an=20
issue</RCC>

saving a single byte is worth quite some effort.
<RCC>I don't disagree and if the consensus is that it is worth the extra =

processing then I have no objection. I realise "bits in the ether" in=20
constrained networks are costly compared to the still fairly trivial=20
extra processing for the escape.</RCC>

Pascal,

I'm not sold on the value of forwarding fragments, it doesn't 
fundamentally change the amount of data that needs to be sent over the 
air and introduces a great deal more complexity in the protocol for a 
somewhat unclear benefit. As soon as fragments are allow to travel more 
than one hop one needs to start dealing with multiple paths, 
non-deterministic RTT, and all sorts of complexity that could arise 
between the link-layer forwarding scheme to move fragments through the 
network and the IP routing scheme (for example, what happens if there 
was an IP routing header that didn't fit in the first fragment?).

However, I think that fragment recovery is a brilliant idea. Without 
some form of fragment recovery, the probability of loosing a packet 
increases exponentially with the number of fragments and even moderate 
frame loss rates can have a very dramatic effect on performance as a 
result.As RFC4944 currently stands, it only takes a single lost 
fragment, and the entire end-to-end packet needs to be resent, which can 
be very expensive when dealing with a large MTU.

Cheers,
Owen

Hi.

We submitted a updated(03) draft about IPv6 over NFC.

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hong-6lo-ipv6-over-nfc/

At Honolulu meeting,  we received comments from Carsten and Alex.
We updated the draft based on these comments.
Thanks for Carsten and Alex.

It is appreciate to give comment and feedbacks.

As agreed at Honolulu meeting, we hope to move forward (become a WG
document).

Best regards.

Yong-Geun.

        Title           : Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Near Field
Communication

Abstract:
   Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
   and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other
   by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no
   more than 10 cm.  NFC standards cover communications protocols and
   data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.
   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC
   Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available
   in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This
   document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN
   techniques.

Hi, thank you for this new version.

With respect to the formation of an Interface ID, I have a couple of 
comments.

- the u/l bit (universal/local): would be a good idea to refer to
   RFC7136 :-)
   One wonders what's the potential use of this bit in NFC?  Because one
   is free to use that bit position in a way deemed appropriate and
   useful for NFC, rather than universal/local; I doubt u/l significance
   has any particular meaning for an IPv6 address: the
   prefix is globally unique and so the address is 'universal'.

draft says:
>    In the case of NFC-enabled device address, the "Universal/Local" bit
>    MUST be set to 0 RFC4291 [7].  Only if the NFC-enabled device address
>    is known to be a public address the "Universal/Local" bit can be set
>    to 1.

- a question: if the NFC LLC address is 6-bit, why do we need to
   generate a 64bit Interface ID?  Wouldn't it be more appropriate to
   generate a 6bit Interface ID?  There may be some advantages in doing
   so (avoid waste, extend subnets beyond 64bit SLAAC/Ethernet).

Well, that's already very cool, Owen.



Let me try, though, to convince you that forwarding the fragments is indeed=
 advantageous, in particular, admittedly, in the context of 6TiSCH.



The discussion below comes from experience of actual ultimate congestion re=
ached in networking devices under load, but the same is generically valid i=
n multiple environments, including 6lowpan / rpl routers, where congestion =
will be reached even soon due to limited buffer capacity.



Say that a packet is cut in 3 6lowpan fragments, and there are 2 routers in=
 between sender and listener.

Say they are all in a same interference domain so a packet cannot be forwar=
ded at multiple hops in parallel.

In the tables below, I noted 'I' a fragment resident in memory and (I) a fr=
agment pending ack to be freed from memory.



If we recompose at each hop, we get the picture below




Sender


Router 1


Router 2


Receiver


T=3D0


III


T=3D1


II(I)


I


T=3D2


I(I)


II


T=3D3


(I)


III


T=3D4


II(I)


I


T=3D5


I(I)


II


T=3D6


(I)


III


T=3D7


II(I)


I


T=3D8


I(I)


II


T=3D9


(I)


III




Now, if we forward the fragments without any streamlining because of the sa=
me interference domain assumption above:




Sender


Router 1


Router 2


Receiver


T=3D0


III


T=3D1


II(I)


I


T=3D2


II


(I)


I


T=3D3

T=3D4

I



(I)


II


T=3D7


(I)


I


II


T=3D8


(I)


I


II


T=3D9



(I)


III




No magic, it takes the exact same time to forward the packet end to end in =
either case.



Yet, we can already see the major benefit of forwarding fragments, which is=
 really that intermediate routers only store one fragment at a time, instea=
d of peak of 3 in this case, up to 20+ in worst case.



This makes all the difference in the work for an intermediate router that i=
s on the way of multiple flows. The router become rapidly unable to cope wi=
th multiple large packets which are dropped.



Behind this simple reasoning, there is the traditional wisdom that the netw=
ork is the worst place to store your data.  This traditional wisdom is crit=
ical to LLN and should not be forgotten.



Now, if the interference domain is not an issue, such as is the case with 6=
TiSCH with the TSCH technology, then we can streamline as follows:




Sender


Router 1


Router 2


Receiver


T=3D0


III


T=3D1


II(I)


I


T=3D2


II


(I)


I


T=3D3


I(I)


I


(I)


I


T=3D4


I


(I)


I


I


T=3D5


(I)


I


(I)


II


T=3D6


(I)


I


II


T=3D7



(I)


III


T=3D8


T=3D9




At T=3D3, router 1 send the 1st fragment to router 2.

At T=3D4, the sender endpoint sends the second fragment to router 1 while a=
t the same time router 2 sends the first fragment to the receiver endpoint.

It results that the overall need for buffers is still one per hop but the o=
verall latency is now reduced.



Conclusion:

Forwarding fragments reduces 1) the need for buffers in the routers and 2) =
the latency. Both are quite critical benefits.

Make no mistake, these concepts are 1) important and 2) not new to LLNs in =
any fashion.

The issues were known and addressed in classical/legacy switched networks s=
uch as frame relay.



I actually attach some slideware that discusses some of the traditional swi=
tching wisdom that probably applies in a similar fashion in multi-hop LLN.

What would be extremely sad would be to rediscover those issues the hard wa=
y, by lack of historical background.



Cheers,



Pascal



PS ) Now, I can also draw a picture of what happens in the non-perfect case=
 where retries are exhausted for a given fragment between 2 routers, in eit=
her mode.

I understand that you are already convinced that the end to end recovery is=
 much needed. I'd add to it that flow control is also much needed, since th=
ere is no value pushing more fragments then there are non-hops in the netwo=
rk.

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">The discussion below comes from experience of act=

ame is generically valid in multiple environments, including 6lowpan / rpl =
routers, where congestion will be
 reached even soon due to limited buffer capacity.<o:p></o:p></p>

and there are 2 routers in between sender and listener.

 a packet cannot be forwarded at multiple hops in parallel.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; I'm not sold on the value of forwarding frag=
ments, it doesn't</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; fundamentally change the amount of data that=
 needs to be sent over the</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; air and introduces a great deal more complex=
ity in the protocol for a</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; somewhat unclear benefit. As soon as fragmen=
ts are allow to travel more</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; than one hop one needs to start dealing with=
 multiple paths,</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; non-deterministic RTT, and all sorts of comp=
lexity that could arise</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; between the link-layer forwarding scheme to =
move fragments through the</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; network and the IP routing scheme (for examp=
le, what happens if there</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; was an IP routing header that didn't fit in =
the first fragment?).</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; </p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; However, I think that fragment recovery is a=
 brilliant idea. Without</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; some form of fragment recovery, the probabil=
ity of loosing a packet</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; increases exponentially with the number of f=
ragments and even moderate</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; frame loss rates can have a very dramatic ef=
fect on performance as a</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; result.As RFC4944 currently stands, it only =
takes a single lost</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; fragment, and the entire end-to-end packet n=
eeds to be resent, which can</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; be very expensive when dealing with a large =
MTU.</p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt; Abstract:</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be =
routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled at</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every hop of a =
multihop link where lower layer fragmentation occurs.</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering tha=
t the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 802.15.4 frame =
can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case, a packet =
might end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the 6LoWPAN =
shim layer.&nbsp; If a single one of those fragments is</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lost in transmi=
ssion, all fragments must be resent, further</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contributing to=
 the congestion that might have caused the initial</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; packet loss.&nb=
sp; This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward and</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recover individ=
ual fragments that might be lost over multiple hops</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between 6LoWPAN=
 endpoints.</p>

For regarding RFC 7136, we will check the relation.

As you said that, we guess that this one bit(U/L bit) can be used for NFC.
But, for the consistency of previous IPv6-over-foo WG documents and
the interworking with other IPv6 addresses, we follow the general method of
U/L bit.

It looks like not only 6lo WG issues but also other WG issues such as IPv6
and ...
In the current version, it is written for the consistency of previous
IPv6-over foo documents and
the interworking with other IPv6 addresses.

Best regards.

Yong-Geun.

Hi Pascal,

I thought the call where this idea of overloading the mesh header was presen=
ted was met with general discontent. =20

Also, the rfc4944 calls it the mesh header, it isn't called the mesh-under h=
eader.  The mesh header is very much in use today, and not purely for mesh-u=
nder conceptual designs. =20

I would be wary of proposals that greatly alter the 6lo header, especially t=
he dispatch bits, rather than extend it in very general ways.

Martin

Hi Martin,

The discussion already caused a rethinking of the idea. If it is not enough=
 we can dig further.

The idea as presented in the draft now is not to deprecate the mesh header =
but to allow in a different network to use the bits differently knowing tha=
t devices will have to be homogeneous inside one network.

You were the advocate to protect the future by not consuming too many bits =
in the NHC proposal. You also realize that the mesh header consumes 1/3 of =
the whole dispatch space, without a way to extend what's done inside. This =
is not protecting the future.

The new proposal allows to encode the existing MH with limited change but n=
ow it is extensible. The price to pay is different network. And the questio=
n to the group is whether that is acceptable.

Even if there are implementations today, RFC 4944 is not an internet std an=
d we have just seen the very beginning of the IoT. Better fix things now th=
an later...

Pascal

>> Abstract:
>>  This specification provides a new 6LoWPAN dispatch type for use in
>>  Route-over and mixed Mesh-under and Route-over topologies, that
>>  reuses the encoding of the mesh type defined in RFC 4944 for pure
>>  Mesh-under topologies.  This specification also defines a method to
>>  compress RPL Option (RFC6553) information and Routing Header type 3
>>  (RFC6554), an efficient IP-in-IP technique and opens the way for
>>  further routing techniques.  This extends 6LoWPAN Transmission of
>>  IPv6 Packets (RFC4944), and is applicable to new link-layer types
>>  where 6LoWPAN is being defined.

Hi Martin,

I think it would benefit this discussion if we could learn more about =
these use cases.
In RFC 4944, the =E2=80=9CMesh Header=E2=80=9D definitely was meant for =
mesh-under; we even have a section called

  11.  Frame Delivery in a Link-Layer Mesh*)

to discuss the use of the Mesh Header in forwarding adaptation layer =
packets between link-layer entities.  But that of course doesn=E2=80=99t =
mean there aren=E2=80=99t other ways to make good use of the Mesh Header =
=E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99d like to learn more about those.

Gr=C3=BC=C3=9Fe, Carsten

*) The short forms =E2=80=9Cmesh-under=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Croute-over=E2=
=80=9D weren=E2=80=99t as much in use in 2007, so this is a long form =
trying to say =E2=80=9Cmesh-under=E2=80=9D.
