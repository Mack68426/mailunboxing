[[DR]] I agree with the argument made by Juergen in the PS. My personal pre=
ference is for a 'strict' charter wording for this WG for the development o=
f the MIB module and a separate discussion (here or some place else) about =
the broader aspects of management of resource-constrained nodes.=20

So, I'm of the opinion that the question isn't strict or open charter =
but rather that most work in this space doesn't use snmp for =
configuration, just instrumentation and that doesn't seem likely to =
change.

I like that text btw.

I agree with Juergen's earlier comments regarding the use of SMIv2 -- seems=
 like we would want to keep the same way of describing our data model.  But=
 I would probably go a bit further.

I would pursue SMIv2/SNMP as a management infrastructure, and later, if som=
ething better comes along, someone can propose that.    SNMP management inf=
rastructures (management stations, etc) are likely to be what we run into f=
or managed LLNs, it would be nice if we what we come up with can play in th=
ose environments, without any loss of semantics or functionality.

So, I'm of the opinion that the question isn't strict or open charter but r=
ather that most work in this space doesn't use snmp for configuration, just=
 instrumentation and that doesn't seem likely to change.

I like that text btw.

yes they are and imho it does as well.

Not entirely, because of the next sentence.  Your suggestion would result i=
n this:

The "and" in the first sentence implies that the link model is separate
from "implications on IPv6 architecture", and the second sentence is only
about things that do have such implications, implying it says nothing about
alternate link models. =20

I think the following would be clearer:

all.

Dear all,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
I took the last email in the email threat to summarize my thoughts.

It seems that the latest proposal on the table is:

OLD:

   Related MIB modules

NEW:

   MIB module for the counters in the 6LoWPAN layer for basic monitoring
   and troubleshooting

It goes in the right direction, but it's not enough.
I would go for

   Information model for the counters in the 6LoWPAN layer for basic monitoring
   and troubleshooting, and a mapping to a data model (MIB module in this case)

Why?
- SNMP being the way to monitor counters on a constrained node now, I 
could buy that!
However, just telling "MIB modules" in the charter might give the wrong 
impression that SNMP is the only way to manage a constrained node. We 
don't know the answer at this point in time (at least, I don't)
- We really need to make the difference between information model and 
data model (RFC 3444)
Mapping from an information model to a different data model/protocol is 
the right way to go

Notes:
- the distinction between information model and data model doesn't imply 
that we need to have two deliverables.
- I'm in line with Dan regarding this comment "a separate discussion 
(here or some place else) about the broader aspects of management of 
resource-constrained nodes. "  This discussion should happen sometime, 
somewhere.

Regards, Benoit

SNMP management infrastructures (management stations, etc) are likely to be what we run into for managed LLNs, it would be nice if we what we come up with can play in those environments, without any loss of semantics or functionality.

It might help to look at what we are talking about here. The 'information
model' really is this Case Diagram:

                          interface layer

In the past, we simply recoded such things in MIB modules in the
'Overview' section and we were done.

So is your proposal that we s/Overview/Information Model/ ? Well,
if that is what is being called for...

I don't want to discuss the format or language for the information model 
here, but that would be a start. Yes.

I know that you know all about SNMP/MIB, NETCONF/YANG, Information/Data 
Model, and more, and that all this is clear in your mind. And I guess 
that you have your views on how to manage constrained devices: fine.

The issue I was trying to solve with, what could appear to be a trick to 
you (knowing your background), is sending the wrong message in a 
charter. And that message could/will be taken as granted by the rest of 
the pack.

Glad that we converge.

I still believe the parenthesis is a bit constraining (pun not =

 More importantly, new IP-over-foos may need new counters, so limiting =

For the ~ 10 % of work of the WG that is concerned with defining those =

I think the decision that the current one will be a MIB module should be =
in the milestones, and the charter should say how we arrive at these =

My observation is that this protocol layer is rather simple and in the
past we did not ask for explicit information models for things that
are reasonably simple. But perhaps those times are over...

It's not black or white.
Constrained nodes are non traditional managed devices.

 not the least because over time we will have more than one case.  (We also=
 have at least one thing that actually is not a counter.)  More importantly=

I agree with you on this point. It appears to me that we narrow down
the charter to a very small part of work, and we would end up
rechartering very soon, for example if a "6lobac" module is proposed.
Also, the proposed wording only includes counters; what about
read-write objects such as flags to provision objects? Would we want
to exclude that?

Yes.

Regarding Benoit's proposal of separating information and data module,
I am not sure whether this requires a separate deliverable; but as
Benoit said, this is not necessarily related, and could be a section
of, e.g., the 6lowpan MIB module. That could be part of the discussion
how to structure this once the WG is formed.

How about the following text:
- Information and data models (e.g., MIB modules) for these adaptation
layers for basic provisioning, monitoring and troubleshooting.

Best regards
Ulrich

Strike provisioning; I don't think we know how to do this.

Maybe the term does not reflect what I meant. The previous proposal
used the word "counters" and "monitoring", and I wondered if that
would exclude "read-write" elements of a MIB module, such as for
setting a flag or other parameter.

A first draft version of the IETF88 agenda is out.
** THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE ** for conflict resolution,=20
so please don't make travel arrangements based on it.

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda built from that. =20
All times are PST (UTC-0800).
The Constrained Node/Network group meetings are nicely spread out over =
the week.

The lwig/6tisch conflict is unfortunate; this will split the audience.

The oauth conflict on Monday is survivable, we'll do all =
security-related CoRE work on Thursday then.

Hi,

below is an updated version of the charter based on the discussions on
the list. Note that Brian needs the charter updates by today COB in
order to have it ready for the next IESG telechat (or otherwise it
would be delayed).


charter
====================
6lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node
networks with the characteristics of:
* limited power, memory and processing resources
* hard upper bounds on state, code space and processing cycles
* optimization of energy and network bandwidth usage
* lack of some layer 2 services like complete device connectivity and
  broadcast/multicast

Specifically, 6lo will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies
(RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in
constrained node networks

================
OLD
2. Related MIB modules

NEW
2. Information and data models (e.g., MIB modules) for these
adaptation layers for basic monitoring and troubleshooting.
================

3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to more
than one adaptation layer specification

4. Maintenance and informational documents required for the existing
IETF specifications in this space.

Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in scope.
6lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance.
================
OLD
For adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on
IPv6 architecture, 6man will be notified about 6lo's working group
last call. Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by
using IPv6 addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND
options) will be closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts
will be fanned out to 6man documents.

NEW
For adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on
IPv6 architecture, 6man will be notified about 6lo's working group
last call. Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by
using IPv6 addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND
options or by exposing to IPv6 a link model different from either
Ethernet or 6lowpan) will be closely coordinated with 6man, and/or
specific parts will be fanned out to 6man documents.
================
Beyond 6man, 6lo will also coordinate with LWIG and INTAREA.

6lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area work. 6lo does not
take on larger cross-layer efforts. The working group will continue to
reuse existing protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and
possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers being
worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of scope. 6lo
will coordinate closely with the working groups in other areas that focus
on constrained node networks, such as ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP).

Oh...Based on the discussions and questions raised in the 6lo BoF during th=
e IETF 87=2C it was decided (before voting for the charter) that we should =
not restrict to the Generic Header Compression. This text "Specifications=
=2C such as header compression=2C that are applicable to more than one adap=
tation layer specification" is new. The original text approved during the B=
oF was "common infrastructure specification such as header compression spec=
ific to constrained node networks". The new text leaves out our work on "IP=
sec header compression" that was presented during the 6lo BoF (http://tools=
.ietf.org/html/draft-raza-6lowpan-ipsec-01). The new wording "applicable to=
 more than one" should not be in the charter. In the 6lo working group we s=
hould be able to discuss the pros and cons of both the generic and the 6LoW=
PAN-styled header compression and adapt the one that is efficient and suita=
ble for the IoT protocols. =20

Subject: [6lo] Charter-04 proposal

Hi=2C
=20
below is an updated version of the charter based on the discussions on
the list. Note that Brian needs the charter updates by today COB in
order to have it ready for the next IESG telechat (or otherwise it
would be delayed).
=20
=20
charter
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
6lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node
networks with the characteristics of:
* limited power=2C memory and processing resources
* hard upper bounds on state=2C code space and processing cycles
* optimization of energy and network bandwidth usage
* lack of some layer 2 services like complete device connectivity and
  broadcast/multicast
=20
Specifically=2C 6lo will work on:
=20
1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN technologies
(RFC4944=2C RFC6282=2C RFC6775) for link layer technologies of interest in
constrained node networks
=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD
2. Related MIB modules
=20
NEW
2. Information and data models (e.g.=2C MIB modules) for these
adaptation layers for basic monitoring and troubleshooting.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=20
3. Specifications=2C such as header compression=2C that are applicable to m=
ore
than one adaptation layer specification
=20
4. Maintenance and informational documents required for the existing
IETF specifications in this space.
=20
Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in scope.
6lo will work closely with the 6man working group=2C which will continue
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
OLD
For adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on
IPv6 architecture=2C 6man will be notified about 6lo's working group
last call. Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g.=2C by
using IPv6 addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND
options) will be closely coordinated with 6man=2C and/or specific parts
will be fanned out to 6man documents.
=20
NEW
For adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on
IPv6 architecture=2C 6man will be notified about 6lo's working group
last call. Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g.=2C by
using IPv6 addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND
options or by exposing to IPv6 a link model different from either
Ethernet or 6lowpan) will be closely coordinated with 6man=2C and/or
specific parts will be fanned out to 6man documents.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Beyond 6man=2C 6lo will also coordinate with LWIG and INTAREA.
=20
6lo works on small=2C focused pieces of Internet Area work. 6lo does not
take on larger cross-layer efforts. The working group will continue to
reuse existing protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and
possible.
=20
Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers being
worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of scope. 6lo
will coordinate closely with the working groups in other areas that focus
on constrained node networks=2C such as ROLL (RTG) and CoRE (APP).

Shahid,

the entirety of RFC 6282 would fall under "applicable to more than one =
adaptation layer specification" (it is currently being referenced by =
BT-LE, lowpanz, 6lobac, dect-ule).  One example that we had in mind when =
that phrase was coined was GHC.  So why would =
draft-raza-6lowpan-ipsec-01, which just plugs into the NHC extension =
point of RFC 6282, like GHC does, not be?

Gr=FC=DFe, Carsten

That makes sense to me.

Good!!
I misunderstood it then. I read it as "a single header compression =
scheme that fits to multiple headers, such as GHC".
Thanks for the clarification.

Looks good to me, as well.

Brian - would it be worth the effort to bring together the comments that =
lead to the changes in the latest revision of the charter, as an aid to =
the IESG in the final review?

"3. Specifications, such as header compression, that are applicable to

Has there been any work or concerns discussed to see what's already out

Good point.
We had a similar discussion during the chartering of 6LoWPAN in 2007.

We had good expertise about ROHC in the 6LoWPAN WG and will have the =
same in 6lo.

There are significant differences between ROHC's flow-based compression =
approach and what can be sensibly done on a constrained node. =20
(Instead of reciting all the details, let me just attach a little text =
excerpt from the 6lowpan book.)

In 6LoWPAN, this led us to develop stateless header compression (RFC =
4944) and later header compression relying on global state only (RFC =
6282).  The 6lo work is meant to continue this simple approach.

> Especially the documents describing how to do header compression for

As with ROHC, this is about header compression in the adaptation layer.

The ROHC profiles encode a lot of knowledge on the details of the =
protocols above IP (TCP, RTP, but also ESP), so it was a natural fit to =
do that work in TSV.
So far, in 6LoWPAN header compression we have just a very small =
dependency on UDP itself.
Other above-IP protocols are planned to be addressed by 6lo work such as =
GHC (DTLS, ICMP), but mainly in the form of benchmarking the still very =
basic compression scheme against them, not in the form of interacting =
intricately with them like in ROHC.

It is probably worth to point out that DICE is also looking at ways to =
encode DTLS in a more compact way, which could be used both as an =
alternative end-to-end packet encoding and as part of an adaptation =
layer header compression scheme.  We'll need to coordinate this closely =
with what 6lo does in this space. =20

Gr=FC=DFe, Carsten


(from the 6LoWPAN book:)

The ROHC standards and its predecessors focus on compressing flows of =
packets, such as the sequence of packets from a single TCP connection or =
an RTP stream. They expend considerable complexity for compressing the =
full stack of headers (IP/TCP or IP/UDP/RTP, possibly with embedded =
extension headers) down to a very small, usually single-digit number of =
bytes. This works by setting up flow state for each new =
connection/stream, and stepping through a set of compression states =
during the exchange of the initial packets of the flow until a high =
level of compression is attainable.

The main problem that flow-based header compression needs to solve is =
that the per-flow state, the context, is likely to get out of sync =
between the sender and the receiver when packets get lost. Various =
techniques such as positive acknowledgments or optimistic compression =
with checksums and negative acknowledgments either avoid progressing the =
context state in this case or allow quick recovery (robustness).

While significant efficiencies can be reaped for long-running flows such =
as Voice over IP, the required complexity to achieve these gains ranks =
ROHC among the top dozen most complex IETF protocols just judging from =
specification size, in the same league with SIP [RFC3162], NFSv4 =
[RFC3530], IOTP [RFC2801], iSCSI [RFC3720], IPP [RFC2911], OSPF =
[RFC2328] etc. A protocol of this complexity was judged inappropriate =
for the resource-constrained systems envisaged in a LoWPAN.

Instead, the original 6LoWPAN format standard exclusively employs =
stateless compression, see Section 2.6.1. Without state, there is no =
synchronization problem, and the algorithms become very simple.
[...]
Unfortunately, there is no way to compress the large globally routable =
IPv6 addresses without at least some state. The 6LoWPAN WG has therefore =
agreed to standardize a second header compression method, context-based =
header compression with a slowly evolving global context, discussed in =

Hi Carsten,

This helps me a lot :)

Can we refine the bullet to this text:
NEW
"3. Specifications, such as stateless or globale state only header 
compression, that are applicable to more than one adaptation layer 
specification"

Probably adding the references to it would be good too.

They expend considerable complexity for compressing the full stack of headers (IP/TCP or IP/UDP/RTP, possibly with embedded extension headers) down to a very small, usually single-digit number of bytes. This works by setting up flow state for each new connection/stream, and stepping through a set of compression states during the exchange of the initial packets of the flow until a high level of compression is attainable.

The 6LoWPAN WG has therefore agreed to standardize a second header compression method, context-based header compression with a slowly evolving global context, discussed in Section 2.6.2, with a view to deprecating the stateless-only header compression scheme once context-based compression is completed.

The header compression we're talking about has already been developed in =
6lowpan; 6lo is just intended to continue along that trend.  If you take =
the bullet item you are commenting on out of the context of the rest of =
the charter, I could see the cause for the concern you have raised, but =
if you consider it in the context of the first hunk of text in the =
charter, and the paragraph following the numbered list, I think it's =
clear that it's just talking about more of the same work that was done =
in 6lowpan.

It's also worth noting that Carsten Bormann was the chair of 6lowpan, =
tech advisor to RoHC, and has been instrumental in forming the 6lo =
working group, so from that perspective as well I doubt that the work =
done in RoHC will be lost or ignored by 6lo.

If it has been done in 6lowpan and it has a name, why not reusing the 
name in the charter to make it clear what out of the large field of 
header compression is meant?

I know, as I have been working on rohc too in some old ages.

Benoit Claise has entered the following ballot position for
charter-ietf-6lo-00-04: Block

When responding, please keep the subject line intact and reply to all
email addresses included in the To and CC lines. (Feel free to cut this
introductory paragraph, however.)



The document, along with other ballot positions, can be found here:
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-6lo/



----------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOCK:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no general concern about chartering this WG but I would like to
see a
clarification with respect to this point:

"6lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node
networks with the characteristics of:"

What does Internet Area work mean?
Btw, you want a MIB module, should we add OPS in there?
Proposal: remove "Internet Area"

Same remark for "6lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area
work."
It clashes with

    2. Information and data models (e.g., MIB modules) for these
    adaptation layers for basic monitoring and troubleshooting.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Via email, Carsten proposed: "I think the decision that the current one
will be a MIB module should be in the milestones, and the charter should
say how we arrive at these decisions."

The proposed milestones addition would be a plus.

Interesting comment.  What was meant was that the MIB modules (IMs/DMs) =

I would have problem dropping the references to "Internet Area".  You
are correct that there are some work items that cross area boundaries.

I have the chairs pulling milestones together.  I will make sure this

You are correct that we are not subsuming OAM, but the suggested change
is not going to impact the work that needs to be done.

It doesn't really have a proper name.
Saying "stateless and global-state-only header compression" is =
descriptive of the current approaches, but not really making the point =
properly (we might even invent a third approach).

If we want to give it a name, how about "low-complexity header =
compression".

No problem with me, but then define what you mean.
Honestly, I don't know what's meant by "Internet Area work".

Did we insert "Internet Area" to address someone else's concern about 6lo wo=
rk scoping? =20

To me, "Internet Area" means "work appropriate to the IETF Internet Area".  P=
erhaps "Internet Area" is redundant considering 6lo's position as an INT Are=
a WG.

I don't feel strongly about keeping or dropping "Internet Area".  I honestly=
 don't think it makes a difference.

I don't have easy access to the charter.  Is there the usual "recharter for n=
ew topics" included somewhere?  Can we make a case that 6lo's position in IN=
T Area is implicit and sufficient limit on its scope to pass the IESG?

No.  There is no text in the charter that currently says the WG will
re-charter to take on new work.

Carsten reminded me there is other scope-limiting text in the charter.

For the IESG - as 6lo is in the INT Atea, and there is other scope-limiting t=

Not for me.
Note: there is a second instance

    6lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area work. 6lo does not take on
    larger cross-layer efforts. The working group will continue to reuse existing
    protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

=================

3. Specifications, such as low-complexity header compression, that are
applicable to more than one adaptation layer specification
=================

I agree that it is implied by being an INT area WG. Removing the word
"Internet Area" would result in:

===================
OLD
6lo focuses on Internet Area work that is needed for constrained node
networks with the characteristics of:

NEW
6lo focuses on work that is needed for constrained node
networks with the characteristics of:
===================

and

===================
OLD
6lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area work.

NEW
6lo works on small, focused pieces of work.
===================


Alternatively for the latter:
===================
OLD
6lo works on small, focused pieces of Internet Area work. 6lo does not
take on larger cross-layer efforts.

NEW
6lo works on small, focused pieces of work and does not take on larger
cross-layer efforts.
===================

Regards
Ulrich

COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The discussion went in the right direction. I trust Brian will take of my
BLOCK. Cleared now.

Via email, Carsten proposed: "I think the decision that the current one
will be a MIB module should be in the milestones, and the charter should
say how we arrive at these decisions."

The proposed milestones addition would be a plus.

Hi Ulrich,

Personally, I prefer the second option.
Anyway, I clear my BLOCK.

A new IETF working group has been formed in the Internet Area. For
additional information please contact the Area Directors or the WG
Chairs.

IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes (6lo)
------------------------------------------------
Current Status: Proposed WG

Chairs:
  Ulrich Herberg <ulrich@herberg.name>
  Samita Chakrabarti <samita.chakrabarti@ericsson.com>

Technical advisors:
  Ralph Droms <rdroms.ietf@gmail.com>

Assigned Area Director:
  Brian Haberman <brian@innovationslab.net>

Mailing list
  Address: 6lo@ietf.org
  To Subscribe: https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/6lo
  Archive: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/maillist.html

Charter:

6lo focuses on the work that facilitates IPv6 connectivity over 
constrained node networks with the characteristics of:
* limited power, memory and processing resources
* hard upper bounds on state, code space and processing cycles
* optimization of energy and network bandwidth usage
* lack of some layer 2 services like complete device connectivity and
  broadcast/multicast

Specifically, 6lo will work on:

1. IPv6-over-foo adaptation layer specifications using 6LoWPAN 
technologies (RFC4944, RFC6282, RFC6775) for link layer technologies of 
interest in constrained node networks

2. Information and data models (e.g., MIB modules) for these
adaptation layers for basic monitoring and troubleshooting.

3. Specifications, such as low-complexity header compression, that are
applicable to more than one adaptation layer specification

4. Maintenance and informational documents required for the existing 
IETF specifications in this space.

Only specifications targeting constrained node networks are in scope. 
6lo will work closely with the 6man working group, which will continue 
to work on IP-over-foo documents outside the constrained node network 
space and will continue to be the focal point for IPv6 maintenance.  For 
adaptation layer specifications that do not have implications on IPv6 
architecture, 6man will be notified about 6lo's working group last call. 
Specifications that might have such an impact (e.g., by using IPv6 
addresses in a specific way or by introducing new ND options or by 
exposing to IPv6 a link model different from either Ethernet or 6lowpan) 
will be closely coordinated with 6man, and/or specific parts will be 
fanned out to 6man documents. Beyond 6man, 6lo will also coordinate with 
LWIG and INTAREA.

6lo works on small, focused pieces of work, but does not take on larger
cross-layer efforts. The working group will continue to reuse existing 
protocols and mechanisms whenever reasonable and possible.

Security and management work that is not specific to the link layers 
being worked on is out of scope. Work related to routing is out of 
scope. 6lo will coordinate closely with the working groups in other 
areas that focus on constrained node networks, such as ROLL (RTG) and 
CoRE (APP).

What does "6lo Documents on information model and data model work
starts" mean in the light of the May 2014 milestone?

Sounds good (actually this should be done by the end of November).

(GHC-06 expired a couple of days ago, I was waiting for 6lo approval and =
will now resubmit as "draft-bormann-6lo-ghc-00".)

Let's feedback with Kerry about this -- there was some work back at the =
BACnet base that needed to be done.
I don't know how far advanced that is.  (I hope we can have a resubmit =
as -6lo before the deadline, too.)

This has already received some review in 6LoWPAN, so I think it could be =
in the 2013 bucket.

Similar comment as with 6lobac.

These sound about right for May 2014, we should have finished the =
necessary discussion by then.

(This only makes sense if we adopt it earlier, and may be a bit late =
actually.)

I'm missing a milestone for GHC WGLC.

These could come earlier or later, depending on foo.
Do one milestone per foo.

Interesting idea.  Let's talk about that in Vancouver.

Again, I'd do this per document.

I'm not sure the roadmap document should turn RFC at this point already, =
but we can discuss this in Vancouver.

Hi Carsten,

Thanks for the feedback.

The milestone is in a drafty form now.  The drafts are grouped and the time=
line indicates the boundary timeline. Some of them can be done earlier than=
 the deadline - for example the GHC and LowpanZ drafts by Nov if they are r=
eady to proceed.

As for the 6lowpan-mib document, we can start discussing the document and a=
sk the wg for input.

Let's discuss the rest in the wg meeting and come up with a more realistic =
milestone timeline after that.

-Samita

Sounds good (actually this should be done by the end of November).

(GHC-06 expired a couple of days ago, I was waiting for 6lo approval and wi=
ll now resubmit as "draft-bormann-6lo-ghc-00".)

Let's feedback with Kerry about this -- there was some work back at the BAC=
net base that needed to be done.
I don't know how far advanced that is.  (I hope we can have a resubmit as -=
6lo before the deadline, too.)

This has already received some review in 6LoWPAN, so I think it could be in=
 the 2013 bucket.

Similar comment as with 6lobac.

(This only makes sense if we adopt it earlier, and may be a bit late actual=
ly.)

I'm missing a milestone for GHC WGLC.

> June    2014 WG last call for adopted IPv6-over-foo I-Ds

These could come earlier or later, depending on foo.
Do one milestone per foo.

Hi Juergen,

The milestone is a draft one - we need to discuss and modify it after Nov m=
eeting.

The information model and MIB development request came as one of the IESG r=
equirements/comments.
Hence it is holding a place in the Milestone so that we make sure we hold a=
 discussion on a need of an information model that applies to 6lo technolog=
ies.
MIB development might be already covered by your draft - but it is helpful =
to have a discussion around it as the scope of 6lo and 6lowpan are differen=
t.

Hope it clarifies the question below.

Regards,
-Samita

And here is the update based on the "final" agenda.
(Which is "final" only in that it will be committed to print; it still =
could change some more.)

Apart from room changes, the changes are:
1) The lwig/6tisch conflict was resolved; unfortunately the moved lwig =
now conflicts with perpass.
2) There will be no ROLL meeting in Vancouver.

Besides the official agenda, there will be unofficial ("hallway") =
meetings.
I have started to collect info on a Wiki page:

	http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/wiki/hallway88

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

All,
     Now that 6lo is an official WG, Ted and I would like to move
forward on closing the 6lowpan WG.  However, there is a draft
(draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle) that originated in 6lowpan, but has not been
published yet.  It currently sits in IESG Evaluation awaiting feedback
from the Bluetooth SIG.

     I would like to ask the 6lo group if anyone would have an objection
to me assigning draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to the 6lo WG.  There are two
potential directions such an adoption could take.  The first is that
there are no issues with the draft as it relates to the Bluetooth SIG
and no work would be needed on the draft.  The other is that issues
arise and the IESG needs to send the draft back to the WG for
fixes/revisions.

     Can WG participants please respond negatively or positively to the
reassignment of draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to the 6lo WG?  I will take
feedback until Oct. 28th, 2013.

Regards,
Brian

As WG chair of 6lowpan and participant of 6lo:

Yes, this is the right thing to do.
No further action will be needed until we hear from BT-SIG.
If changes are indeed required based on that input, the 6lo WG is the =
one to do the work.

I agree this draft should move to 6lo.

There is a draft in 6man, draft-ietf-6man-6lobac-01, that is in a similar
state: awaiting standards action by the BACnet Committee of ASHRAE
(in progress).  Would you mind issuing a poll to see if we can get that
draft moved to 6lo as well?

Thanks, -K-

I am curious as to your rationale for wanting to move the 6lobac draft
now.  In the case of the btle draft there is a desire to close a WG, but
there is no such need with 6man.

That being said, there will be a discussion in Vancouver over drafts
(the 6lobac one included) that could/should be moved to 6lo.  That is
highlighted in the draft version of the milestones that have been posted
to the mailing list.

Regards,
Brian

Hi Brian, 6lo,

As 6lo participant, but more so as one of the authors of the draft in quest=
ion, I'm fine for reassigning the draft to 6lo. I can post draft-ietf-6lo-b=
tle-00 as soon as you ask.

I would also like to communicate to this WG that we have multiple active au=
thors on the draft, and hence this work item would come with editors attach=
ed:-D

I am (and have been) actually working on this topic in BT SIG, and I believ=
e it is highly likely that we need to touch the draft a bit more than just =
add the L2CAP channel identifier that IETF requested from BT SIG. However, =
the changes should be quite straightforward. After the BT SIG has advanced =
and needed changes are known, a decision needs to be made whether the docum=
ent should drop back to WG(LC) or not. For now the IETF side of the actual =
work needs to stay in holding pattern waiting for BT SIG.

Best regards,

Teemu

Subject: [6lo] Adopting draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle

All,
     Now that 6lo is an official WG, Ted and I would like to move forward o=
n closing the 6lowpan WG.  However, there is a draft
(draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle) that originated in 6lowpan, but has not been publ=
ished yet.  It currently sits in IESG Evaluation awaiting feedback from the=
 Bluetooth SIG.

     I would like to ask the 6lo group if anyone would have an objection to=
 me assigning draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to the 6lo WG.  There are two potenti=
al directions such an adoption could take.  The first is that there are no =
issues with the draft as it relates to the Bluetooth SIG and no work would =
be needed on the draft.  The other is that issues arise and the IESG needs =
to send the draft back to the WG for fixes/revisions.

     Can WG participants please respond negatively or positively to the rea=
ssignment of draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to the 6lo WG?  I will take feedback u=
ntil Oct. 28th, 2013.

Regards,
Brian

I think that this is a great idea and then lets get 6lowpan shut down -

Thanks for the input.

First, I don't think we would not need to rename the draft.  That tends

ge.

Regards,
Brian

Hi Anders,

Thanks for your detail comments -- those are quite useful!

Please see in-line.

Subject: draft-chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd - Proposing new use c=
ase "Set-and-forget off-line network"

[cross-posting 6man / 6lo]

Samita Chakrabarti et al,

Great draft which addresses important issues for low-power wireless network=
 technologies.

After reading the draft, it seems to me that you would benefit adding one m=
ore use case - and addressing the derived requirement(s).

Proposed use case:
-------
A.7.  Set-and-forget off-line networks
    Home control modules designed for networked environments may be deploye=
d =20
    in very simple settings like garden path lighting controlled by wireles=
s =20
    light and motion sensors. Once the network has been created and sensors=
 =20
    have been associated with the light modules, the installer takes away t=
he =20
    configuration tool which was used to set up the network. Most likely a =
ULA =20
    prefix is used, since multiple hops may be needed. None of the sensors =
and =20
    light modules has the capability of handing out fresh prefixes. Thus, f=
or =20
    a set-and-forget style off-line network to work, the nodes must be  abl=
e to
    operate forever without trying to refresh its address registration.

    In another instance of an off-line network, a key-fob style remote cont=
rol is paired
    to a few lamp modules. The controller creates its own small off-line ne=
twork.
    The controller is not only battery powered and sleeping. It is far away=
 in its owner's pocket.
    Address registration is not possible.
=20
     The manufacturer of the lamp module wants to sell exactly the same lam=
p
     module to large network deployments where address registration is used=
.
     Since this class of devices provide no local configuration interface, =
the behaviour needs
     to be controlled via some sort of auto-configuration.
-------
(end of proposed use case)=20

[SC>]  =3D=3D=3D> Added.

One solution could be to introduce a special interpretation of registration=
 lifetime 0xFFFF as infinite and stating that default routers SHOULD NOT ad=
vertise this value.

Such an approach would resemble existing text in RFC4861:

 Valid Lifetime
                      32-bit unsigned integer.  The length of time in
                      seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent)
                      that the prefix is valid for the purpose of on-link
                      determination.  A value of all one bits
                      (0xffffffff) represents infinity.  The Valid
                      Lifetime is also used by [ADDRCONF].


The authors may have other preferred solutions?
[SC>] =3D=3D=3D> As discussed off-line that , the valid lifetime for the pr=
efix is still valid and the ARO lifetime applies to the registration lifeti=
me.  We have discussed some of the issues with  allowing permanent registra=
tion (especially with NCE cache entries). So at this point we have agreed  =
to keep the ARO lifetime range as it is.

Best regards,
-Samita

I think assigning future responsibility for draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to =
the 6lo WG is a good idea and I support that action.

I think it is the right thing to do. I am supportive of this
reassignment. I would prefer that the draft be renamed though, as the
tools will look for the wg moniker in the draft name in order for it
to show up under

http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/6lo/

Thanks
Suresh

Hi Suresh,

one option would be to show also draft-ietf-6lowpan-* drafts on the
6lo WG page (thanks Carsten for that thought!). We have confirmed with
the webmaster that this is easily doable.

I'd suggest to wait until October 28, which is the final date that
Brian proposed for getting comments about asignment of
draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to 6lo.

Best regards
Ulrich

Samita and Anders,

I guess I don't understand the correlation between the set-and-forget 
use case and address registrations in Anders' email.

Is the assertion that there can't be any additional nodes appearing in 
the network, hence there is no need to have DAD functionality after the 
initial setup?

Even if that was the case, there is typically a need for someone to send 
RAs to refresh the lifetime on the existing prefix, and some way for a 
host to discover link-layer addresses of other hosts.

Is the assumption that the nodes would take all of that (including the 
IPv6 and link-layer addresses of all the other hosts in the network) and 
save that to persistent storage?
If not, how would the nodes recover if they halt (due to a line power 
failure or running out of battery) and reboot?


For the home automation stuff I've seen a key benefit is to have a 
controller, which allows the user to reprogram the lights and sensors. 
That can be either a dedicated controller or a gateway plus a remote 
app/controller.

In those cases the dedicated controller or gateway would be a natural 
place to perform all the functions relation to address registrations and 
prefixes.

So I don't quite understand where this use case would appear in practice 
- a set of sensors and lights whose functional behavior is frozen in 
time doesn't match what I see in the home automation space.

Regards,
    Erik

We have discussed some of the issues with  allowing permanent registration (especially with NCE cache entries). So at this point we have agreed  to keep the ARO lifetime range as it is.

Hi Erik,

As far as I understand that the controller in Z-wave is not the same behavi=
or as in NEAR router.
The controller is quite specific to the application -- it seems it once con=
figures the network devices and forgets about the device and it is used for=
 one-time configuration. This seems quite product specific function.

I agree that having a controller function based on ND is quite useful where=
 the controller would be responsible for assigning addresses and managing t=
hem through registration and the controller may or may not have the routing=
 capabilities.

I am not quite clear why the controller in Ander's example would need the r=
egistration  for one time.
The use case was added in the appendix since the application partially uses=
 the efficient-ND mechanisms.

Anders can explain the reasons behind  the particular function and relation=
ship with registration.

Thanks for bringing it up.
-Samita

 new use case "Set-and-forget off-line network"


Samita and Anders,

I guess I don't understand the correlation between the set-and-forget use c=
ase and address registrations in Anders' email.

Is the assertion that there can't be any additional nodes appearing in the =
network, hence there is no need to have DAD functionality after the initial=
 setup?

Even if that was the case, there is typically a need for someone to send RA=
s to refresh the lifetime on the existing prefix, and some way for a host t=
o discover link-layer addresses of other hosts.

Is the assumption that the nodes would take all of that (including the
IPv6 and link-layer addresses of all the other hosts in the network) and sa=
ve that to persistent storage?
If not, how would the nodes recover if they halt (due to a line power failu=
re or running out of battery) and reboot?


For the home automation stuff I've seen a key benefit is to have a controll=
er, which allows the user to reprogram the lights and sensors.=20
That can be either a dedicated controller or a gateway plus a remote app/co=
ntroller.

In those cases the dedicated controller or gateway would be a natural place=
 to perform all the functions relation to address registrations and prefixe=
s.

So I don't quite understand where this use case would appear in practice
- a set of sensors and lights whose functional behavior is frozen in time d=
oesn't match what I see in the home automation space.

Regards,
    Erik

One item of our charter reads:

2. Information and data models (e.g., MIB modules) for these
adaptation layers for basic monitoring and troubleshooting.

I would like to trigger a discussion about the information model.
1) What should be contained in the information model(s)?
2) In which form should the information model be submitted (e.g., as
separate draft or as section in a data model draft)?
3) Other discussion points?

Best regards
Ulrich

In http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-schoenw-6lo-lowpan-mib-00,
substitute 'Overview' with 'Information Model' and I think we are
done. The Case Diagram is essentially the information model.

ned-mgmt-03> into two parts:

Filename:        draft-opsawg-ersue-coman-probstate-reqs
Title:           Management of Networks with Constrained Devices: Problem S=
tatement and Requirements
Htmlized:        http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-opsawg-ersue-coman-probst=
ate-reqs-00

Filename:        draft-opsawg-ersue-coman-use-cases
Title:           Management of Networks with Constrained Devices: Use Cases
Htmlized:       http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-opsawg-ersue-coman-use-cas=

Since the 6lowpan WG is shutting down, I support the idea of moving the bt-=
le document to 6lo WG.

Subject: [6lo] Adopting draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle

All,
     Now that 6lo is an official WG, Ted and I would like to move forward o=
n closing the 6lowpan WG.  However, there is a draft
(draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle) that originated in 6lowpan, but has not been publ=
ished yet.  It currently sits in IESG Evaluation awaiting feedback from the=
 Bluetooth SIG.

     I would like to ask the 6lo group if anyone would have an objection to=
 me assigning draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to the 6lo WG.  There are two potenti=
al directions such an adoption could take.  The first is that there are no =
issues with the draft as it relates to the Bluetooth SIG and no work would =
be needed on the draft.  The other is that issues arise and the IESG needs =
to send the draft back to the WG for fixes/revisions.

     Can WG participants please respond negatively or positively to the rea=
ssignment of draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle to the 6lo WG?  I will take feedback u=
ntil Oct. 28th, 2013.

Regards,
Brian

Hi Kerry,


That being said, there will be a discussion in Vancouver over drafts
(the 6lobac one included) that could/should be moved to 6lo.  That is
highlighted in the draft version of the milestones that have been posted
to the mailing list.
I was unaware that such a discussion would take place.  I agree it would
be better to handle draft-ietf-6man-6lobac in that more general context.
-K-


[SC>] Just to clarify the point:
           In Vancouver 6lo meeting, we plan to have a discussion on milest=
ones where we can decide whether 6lobac should be handled in 6lo or should =
stay in 6man.

Thanks,
-Samita

Sokwoo Rhee and I (Cyber Physical Systems Presidential Innovation Fellows) a=
re scheduling a meeting to discuss the PIF program (overall) and our Smart A=
merica Challenge, which was launched today, (www.nist.gov/el/smartamerica.cf=
m or www.smartamerica.org) more specifically.

We are very interested in reaching out to IETFers working on CPS (CPS is rel=
ated to the IoT but with a bent toward stronger control) to find broad parti=
cipation in our upcoming (free) workshop.

We are planning to hold the meeting Monday evening from 7:30pm to 9pm.

We need to get a head count, so please reply to me if you would like to atte=
nd.

	Thanks,
			Geoff

Sorry if this is a duplicate - sent previous from wrong email and I'm 
not sure if it will be forwarded...

-------------

It was pointed out to me that I didn't specify what Monday and where.  I 
guess with the upcoming meeting I was a bit myopic.

To reiterate, Sokwoo and I have launched our PIF CPS project and we are 
trying to gather as many good ideas and people as possible. Part of the 
foundation of a scalable CPS is a "high confidence network" and it is 
our belief that this must be built on open standards such as IP so this 
is why we are coming to the IETF.

Please read more at www.smartamerica.org.

So the meeting is currently planned for Monday November 4 from 7:30pm 
US/Pacific (0300 UTC - I think) until 9:00pm US/Pacific (0500 UTC - I hope).

Again - please reply to me directly if you plan to attend so that we can 
size the room accordingly.

     Thanks,
             Geoff

So as somone pointed out on the 88attendees list, when you include 
multiple timezone you usually get something wrong and I did (a typo)...

The meeting starts at 7:30pm US/Pacific which should be 0330 UTC not 
0300 UTC.

Now back to your regularly scheduled email...
