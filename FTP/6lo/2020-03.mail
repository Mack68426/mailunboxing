Hi YongGeun,

Here is my review of the PLC document. It is a valuable document with a
good synthesize of different standards.It helps to understand the
environment and apply 6lo.

=C2=A7 3.3 MTU

As you say, L2 hides frame size through its own fragmentation procedure,
maybe it good be good to remind that these protocols offer different
modulations and MTU associated with these modulations.
It may have an impact on performance.

$ 3.4 Routing Protocols

I don't understand the classification, RPL and LOADng can be compared, but
the middle item is more linked to a specification than a protocol.

=C2=A7 4.4 ND

This part seems to focus on a PLC network with route-over. Is mesh-under
behavior is still accurate? will it change the ND behavior?

=C2=A75 Internet Connectivity.

I don't understand the use of LPWAN for Internet connectivity. It does not
appear in figure 5.

Hope it helps,

See you

Laurent

Yes that was a side thing and badly worded. I ended up with the following i=
n published 17:
"
        Acting as Bridging Proxy the 6LR MUST proxy ND over the backbone fo=
r registered Link-Local addresses.
"
Happy that -17 overall solves the issue

Applied. It was a reference to "first come first serve".

I favor your second proposal:

 "
    When a Registering Node moves from one 6BBR to the next, the new 6BBR s=
ends
    NA messages over the backbone to update existing NCEs.

Sadly we do not have signaling for a 6LN that is attached on the backbone t=
o tell the 6BBR that but will always delegate 6ND operation and will not ta=
ke over until further notice.
That's one of the things we could do at 6MAN I guess if 6MAN takes over the=
 next phase - that's hopeful thinking but any help / support would be stron=
gly appreciated.
For now, we can only provide example cases like a non-bridgeable LLN interf=
ace, or configuration. Let me reword.
"
   The 6BBR may set the Override flag in the NA messages if it does not
   compete with the Registering Node for the NCE in backbone nodes.
   This is assured if the Registering Node is attached via an interface
   that can not be bridged onto the backbone, making it impossible for
   the Registering Node to defend its own addresses there.  This may
   also be signaled by the Registering Node through a protocol extension
   that is not in scope for this specification.

Doing both.
"
                                                            In that case, a=

Yes, this is what we do in the first 2 bullets.  Changing text to "in that =
case..."

>=20

Cool then. I understand that the DISCUSS is behind us now. I'll reply to th=
e original thread for the COMMENTs.

Many thanks!

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : IPv6 Backbone Router
        Authors         : Pascal Thubert
                          Charles E. Perkins

Abstract:
   This document updates RFC 6775 and RFC 8505 in order to enable proxy
   services for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery by Routing Registrars called
   Backbone Routers.  Backbone Routers are placed along the wireless
   edge of a Backbone, and federate multiple wireless links to form a
   single Multi-Link Subnet.

Dear Laurent Toutain.

Thanks for your comments. Your valuable comments are helpful to improve the
draft.

I guess you reviewed both of 6lo use cases draft(draft-ietf-6lo-use-cases)
and 6lo PLC draft (draft-ietf-6lo-plc) and your comments are mixed between
two drafts.

Although this email thread is related to 6lo use cases draft, I try to
reply your comments and deliver your comments for the regarding of 6lo PLC
draft to other authors of 6lo PLC draft. Please, find my answers inlines.

Best regards.

Yong-Geun.

[Yong-Geun] Thanks for your comments. That is the motivation of the 6lo use
cases draft.

[Yong-Geun] Thanks. I agree to remind. It will be better to apply this
sentence both of two drafts.

I understand your point. It will be more better to find another approach of
classification or description.

I will check again.

[Yong-Geun] Thanks. This comment is only related to 6lo PLC draft. I guess
the usage of LPWAN is for description of the connection to the outside
networks such as Ethernet. As you comment, it will be more better to note
LPWAN in the Figure 5 or modify the content.

	Date            : 2020-03-03

Abstract:
   This document updates RFC 6775 and RFC 8505 in order to enable proxy
   services for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery by Routing Registrars called
   Backbone Routers.  Backbone Routers are placed along the wireless
   edge of a Backbone, and federate multiple wireless links to form a
   single Multi-Link Subnet.

Hello again Mirja

The decision was made in Singapore at the 6lo working group with Suresh.

The minutes are at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-106-6lo/=20
I extracted the below for you:

"
[13:42]
  INTDIR review of 6LoWPAN fragment forwarding                       Pascal
  Thubert                  10 min
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-04
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/106/materials/slides-106-6lo-6lo-fragm=
entation-00
  minimal-fragment and fragment-recovery drafts. Passed WG LC.
  Pascal goes over Dave Thaler's review. Discussion about is the draft
  normative.
   Text introduces behaviour with uppercase that is generic to any FF solut=
ion,
   be it VRB or recovereable fragments. Also discusses pitfalls such as fou=
nd
   with Rahul's experiments. No more a simple description of the Virtual
   Reassembly Buffer technique.
  Suresh: I think its normative.
  Pascal: will add BCP14 text.
  Another comment is hitting Hop Limit while fragmented, how is it reported=
 to
  the source, which source? If send ICMP packet to origin source with
  reconstructed packet, loose all info on cause for the problem (if pb occu=
rred
  with fragments). Should 6lo, independent from this work, document ICMP
  handling behaviour in hc scenarios? Discussion on what proper response sh=
ould
  be to the situation described.

"
All in all the main point was that it is not an article on VRB but a specif=
ication on a "mpls like" forwarding technique.

Also please find below the message that triggered the change:

All the best

Pascal

Dear Pascal,

Yes, based on Suresh's comments during the 6lo session in Singapore, it is =
our understanding that the Intended Status for the "minimal" draft needs to=
 be "Standards Track".

Thanks for your hard work!

That's all the history that I could find. Having been through that change a=
nd again, I'm not inclined to reopen.
But I'm willing to learn. Where exactly do you place the bar?

All the best

Hi Pascal,

Again, yes, you can have normative text in information documents. In the =
minutes below the group concluded correctly, as also mentioned by =
Suresh, that the respective text should be normative. However, that does =
not automatically mean that this document has to be PS.

In any case this is a decision for Suresh to make and I just provided my =
input.

Mirja

Dear Benjamin

Many thanks for your  review this time again!

I answered the track question separately (with you and Mirja), this is a co=
nscious discussion that was debated with Suresh in Singapore, we decided fo=
r STD track and made the changes accordingly.

Let's address the DISCUSS first, more tomorrow on the COMMENTs

For one thing, in https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=3Ddraft-ietf-6lo-mini=
mal-fragment-05.txt text was moved that makes this unreadable.

Changed the first paragraph of the intro to:
"
   The original 6LoWPAN fragmentation is defined in [RFC4944] for use
   over a single Layer 3 hop, though possibly multiple Layer 2 hops in a
   mesh-under network, and was not modified by the [RFC6282] update.
   6LoWPAN operations including fragmentation depend on a Link-Layer
   security that prevents any rogue access to the network.
"

This is certainly correct was better make it explicit. What about:
"
   datagram_tag:  An identifier of a datagram that is locally unique to
      the Layer 2 sender.  Associated with the MAC address of the
      sender, this becomes a globally unique identifier for the datagram
      within the duration of its transmission.

"

Please let me know if that addresses your DISCUSS so I can move on with the=
 COMMENTS

Many thanks again!

Pascal

Yes, and there is no assumption that the fragments will be in order. One co=
uld say that it does not matter.=20
It does a little bit in the case of the recovery since we resend in order s=
o we have a chance that a packet still in flight is acked before it is retr=
ied.
The thing that really matters is the first fragment first.


All the best;

Oh, yes, that would make a difference.

Assuming this is meant to replace the "Secure joining and [...]" text, this

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multihop IPv6 Network
        Authors         : Thomas Watteyne
                          Pascal Thubert
                          Carsten Bormann
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-13.txt
	Pages           : 13
	Date            : 2020-03-05

Abstract:
   This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of
   6LoWPAN fragment over a route-over network.  Forwarding fragments can
   improve both the end-to-end latency and reliability, and reduce the
   buffer requirements in intermediate nodes; it may be implemented
   using RFC 4944 and virtual reassembly buffers.

Dear Benjamin

Many thanks for your  review this time again!

As usual I compiled the proposed changes in an early publication https://ww=
w.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=3Ddraft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-13=20

Let's see below for the other COMMENTs:

You're correct that  the LWIG allows that though the frag recovery does not=
. So it's not a generic thing but a specific thing to the LWIG draft. Also,=
 it has to do with the 6LoWPAN compression that is not the same at intermed=
iate hops, so it's not really an MTU issue. Note that this may have weird i=
mplications like an intermediate node generates a 'final' fragment in addit=
ion to the original ones. The win becomes a loss because a whole additional=
 frame is sent.

Anyway I picked your proposed change. Note that the case happens because of=
 the compression of the source and/or the destination IP when the IID match=
es the MAC address. T hint on that, let me also change the first paragraph =
of section 3 as:
"
  We use Figure 1 to illustrate 6LoWPAN fragmentation.  We assume node
   A forwards a packet to node B, possibly as part of a multi-hop route
   between IPv6 source and destination nodes which may be neither A nor
   B, though 6LoWPAN may compress the IP header better when they are.

It is a generic specification that needs to be completed for a real solutio=
n, but it's still a specification. In particular there's a need to indicate=
 that any FF solution MUST swap the datagram_tag at each hop ans interleave=
 space between fragments on radios. That was not obvious and there may be e=
arly tentative implementations around that made the mistake.

Initially there was a single doc for a very long time https://tools.ietf.or=
g/html/draft-thubert-6lowpan-simple-fragment-recovery-01 (yes that IS old) =
and the blocking debate on whether one needs to change RFC 4944 (or a new R=
FC at all) to do FF. So we ended up with the decision to have 2 specs, one =
that changes RFC 4944 and one that does not and we figured that the one tha=
t does not was pure implementation so it went to LWIG. And we figured that =
there was an over arching spec that any draft, LWIG or new std track , has =
in common so we extracted that, and then there were 3. Initially the over-a=
rching (this) was informational but we concluded with Suresh in Singapore t=
hat 1) the additions from Dave's review made it an Standard Track and 2) th=
at the fragment recovery needed a normative reference to include the normat=
ive text in this.

Very right. What about:

"
   This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of
   6LoWPAN fragment over a route-over network.  Forwarding fragments can
   improve both the end-to-end latency and reliability, and reduce the
   buffer requirements in intermediate nodes; it may be implemented
   using RFC 4944 and virtual reassembly buffers.

Correct. What about
"
   6LoWPAN endpoints:  The 6LoWPAN endpoints are the first and last
      nodes in an unbroken string of 6LoWPAN fragment forwarding nodes.
      They are in charge of generating or expanding a 6LoWPAN header
      from/to a full IPv6 packet.  They are also the only points where
      the fragmentation and reassembly operations take place.

Removing that sentence.

That would mean forwarding a full packet in its compressed form over a hop =
and then fragmenting it over the next hop?
Arguably the compressed form and the uncompressed forms are equivalent, so =
one could do that. Though it is encouraged implicitly with RFC 8138 for the=
 routing headers, I do not believe that implementations of RFC 4944 ever di=
d that.

So I suggest 'typically' instead of "if needed":
"
   Typically, Node A starts with an uncompressed packet and compacts the
   IPv6 packet using the header compression mechanism defined in
   [RFC6282]. =20

=20
We never know when the next hop will send, it may be busy with a queue of o=
ther packets. So there's always a risk unless you schedule like you could w=
ith 6TiSCH. Also a TSCH technology will protect against the hidden terminal=
 but a single channel mesh must let the fragment go farther away. So it's l=
ike the proverbial time it takes for the canon to cool down.:"Enough time".

So I cannot be more precise that: for TSCH, allow the next hop to forward; =
for single channel mesh, several times that because the frame must progress=
 out of interference range.

"Enough time" can be expressed as what's needed for a packet to  " progress=
 beyond the next hop and beyond the interference domain before the next sho=
ws up.  "
 Is that OK?

I changed the first sentence as=20
"

   The Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) [LWIG-VRB] is a particular
   incarnation of a 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding that can be implemented
   without a change to [RFC4944].

Yes, there's a uge variety of MAC PHYs and then even more types of applicat=
ions...

You(re correct that section 3.6 is about high rates - and IPv4 for that mat=
ter.
 That's a relative term. In this case, relative to the datagram_tag.=20
Which hopefully we made large enough for the foreseeable LLN speeds.
But other sections apply, e.g., 3.1 on Virtual Reassembly is spot on.

Exactly. Most of the draft is if high interest for us. I could add "threats=

   "IP Fragmentation Considered Fragile" [FRAG-ILE] discusses security
   threats and other caveats that are linked to using IP fragmentation.
   The 6LoWPAN fragmentation takes place underneath the IP Layer, but
   some issues described there may still apply to 6LoWPAN fragments.

Yep!

     Overlapping fragment attacks are possible with 6LoWPAN fragments
      but there is no known firewall operation that would work on
      6LoWPAN fragments at the time of this writing, so the exposure is
      limited.  An implementation of a firewall SHOULD NOT forward
      fragments but instead should recompose the IP packet, check it in
      the uncompressed form, and then forward it again as fragments if
      necessary.  Overlapping fragments are acceptable as long as they
      contain the same payload.  The firewall MUST drop the whole packet
      if overlapping fragments are encountered that result in different
      data at the same offset.

      larger size of the datagram_tag makes the guessing more difficult

That's not really what I meant. I tried to put it all together below:
"

   *  Evasion of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) leverages
      ambiguity in the reassembly of the fragment.  This attack makes
      little sense in the context of this specification since the
      fragmentation happens within the LLN, meaning that the intruder
      should already be inside to perform the attack.  NDIS systems
      would probably not be installed within the LLN either, but rather
      at a bottleneck at the exterior edge of the network..

Many things again and again!!!

Hi, Pascal,

> It seems that this is the review you made on version 10. I scanned and could not make a difference.

It took me a while to figure out what you were questioning, and now I
understand: you wondered why I reposted the same comments for the -12
version as I had for the -10 version.  Sorry for the confusion, but
that was just an artifact of your posting quick updates (which I do
NOT consider a problem; I'd rather see updates posted!).  The only
purpose for updating my comments, which then got attached to version
-12, was to add the comments at the bottom from Murray.  I did not
actually change any of my own comments there, and, yes, I know you did
address them (thanks!).

Again, sorry for the confusion.  All is good.

Barry

Dear 6Lo WG,

The ROLL WG chairs have requested reviews (from the 6Lo WG) of a ROLL WG
document [1] that updates RFC 8505, one of the products of the 6Lo WG.

Is there anyone who would like to volunteer to review the document, in
particular, with a 6Lo perspective?

Thank you in advance!

Cheers,

Shwetha and Carles

Abstract:
   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
   for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to
   support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart
   meters for electricity.  The inherent advantage of existing
   electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of PLC
   deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices
   raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.  This
   document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained
   PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2.

Abstract:
   This document updates the 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
   defined in RFC 6775 and RFC 8505.  The new extension is called
   Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and it protects the
   owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks
   in a low-power and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this
   extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID) and use it
   with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID
   identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to
   provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an
   address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is
   provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration
   information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.

        Title           : On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multihop IPv6 Network
        Authors         : Thomas Watteyne
                          Pascal Thubert
                          Carsten Bormann

	Pages           : 13
	Date            : 2020-03-09

Abstract:
   This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of
   6LoWPAN fragment over a route-over network.  Forwarding fragments can
   improve both the end-to-end latency and reliability, and reduce the
   buffer requirements in intermediate nodes; it may be implemented
   using RFC 4944 and virtual reassembly buffers.

I would like to summarize this discussion and mention the action points.

1. ND status as part of RPL status:
a) What we have right now?
Ans: 8-bit ND status to be carried in LSB 6-bit RPL status. Though RPL stat=
us is 8-bit as per 6550, the unaware-leaves draft updates this field's two =
MSBs to carry flags, thus leaving 6-bits for carrying ND status.



Pascal > Correct

b) What could be the problem with this?
Ans:  Stuffing 8-bit status to 6-bit is possible today because the ND statu=
s allocations are very few and as of now it looks as if reaching values >=
=3D64 might not happen anytime soon. Anyways the problem is how would 6man/=
6lo know that RPL limits the range of the ND Status. Thus we need 6man/6lo =
to be informed.



Pascal >  Suggestion is to have a IANA action in this draft that limits the=
 6lo status registry to 64 values without changing any RFC, cc=92ing 6lo se=
e if we agree on this.

Pascal > This change would be backward compatible with the current ND draft=
s.



> c) Action Point?
> Ans: Limiting ND status code to 64 values needs to be informed to 6man/6l=
o through an update.


Pascal >  Agreed, cc=92ing 6lo. 6MAN did not contributed to the 6LoWPAN ND =
status so far.


[RJ] Looks like we are in sync for all the above points.

2. RPL status code for DCO (currently 130)
RPL Status code of 130 in DCO indicates that the address has moved i.e., so=
mewhere below/downstream in the sub-dodag the target has changed parents.

It was discussed that 130 may not be an appropriate value but when I checke=
d again it seems all right.

 0
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|E|A|  Value    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

130 =3D=3D 1000 0010

The E bit is set indicate rejection and A bit is unset to indicate non-ND v=
alue.

Thus 130 seems to be the right value.

Action Point? No change if this rationale is correct.



Pascal >  Moved is 3 in 6lo (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8505)



       3   | Moved: The registration failed because it is not the most |

   |       | recent.  This Status indicates that the registration is   |

   |       | rejected because another more recent registration was     |

   |       | done, as indicated by the same ROVR and a more recent     |

   |       | TID.  One possible cause is a stale registration that has |

   |       | progressed slowly in the network and was passed by a more |

   |       | recent one.  It could also indicate a ROVR collision.



Pascal > If we say that Value is the 6Lo status we want 128 + 3, and get 13=
1.  I think that=92s the point we wanted to make.

Dec  Hex       Oct        Bin

    131 83         203       10000011



Pascal > Same here, am I missing something here? Any comments?


[RJ] But the 6lo value is applicable only when 'A' bit is set. With 'A' bit=
 unset, as is the case above, RPL is free to choose its own values for the =
remaining 6bits. Isn't it? I was assuming that the 6-bit registry will not =
be common between 6lo Status Code and RPL Status Code.





Take care,



Pascal

[RJ] Currently ND has 8bits to store 256 values ... RPL needs to carry
the same 8-bits but currently it has space only for 6-bits in RPL
Status field. But as of now only few values of ND status has been used
and using up 256 values (or for that matter 64 values) seem
far-stretched.
Thus one of the opinions is to limit the ND status to 64-bits and
carry as-is in the RPL status.

&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RJ&gt; future extensions to ND ARO status need to c=

&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; (as indicated by Pascal before). But to limit =
ND ARO status to 64bits<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; we need to convince the 6lo/6MAN group that &q=
uot;because of RPL&quot; we need to<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; reduce the size. I am not sure if this is easy=
 to digest!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I thought that we had 6-bits to store 64-values, while ND has 8-bits t=

&gt; 256 values.&nbsp; Please correct me if I mis-understood.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
[RJ] Currently ND has 8bits to store 256 values ... RPL needs to carry<br>
the same 8-bits but currently it has space only for 6-bits in RPL<br>
Status field. But as of now only few values of ND status has been used<br>
and using up 256 values (or for that matter 64 values) seem<br>
far-stretched.<br>
Thus one of the opinions is to limit the ND status to 64-bits and<br>
carry as-is in the RPL status.</span></font></p>

True, we could.

Note that we might understand the "A" bit differently. For me the flag mean=
s that the definition of the value is inherited from a 6lo spec, it does no=
t mean that in runtime the status was imported from a 6lo message.

Now if the node moves to a different root that is attached to a different 6=
BBR, it will get 1100 0011 which is 195. If the node moves within the same =
root, the code will be whatever we decide here. Does the node really care w=
hich case that is?

Maybe we could use 195 as opposed to 130?

Pascal





2. RPL status code for DCO (currently 130)
RPL Status code of 130 in DCO indicates that the address has moved i.e., so=
mewhere below/downstream in the sub-dodag the target has changed parents.

It was discussed that 130 may not be an appropriate value but when I checke=
d again it seems all right.

 0
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|E|A|  Value    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

130 =3D=3D 1000 0010

The E bit is set indicate rejection and A bit is unset to indicate non-ND v=
alue.

Thus 130 seems to be the right value.

Action Point? No change if this rationale is correct.



Pascal >  Moved is 3 in 6lo (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8505)



       3   | Moved: The registration failed because it is not the most |

   |       | recent.  This Status indicates that the registration is   |

   |       | rejected because another more recent registration was     |

   |       | done, as indicated by the same ROVR and a more recent     |

   |       | TID.  One possible cause is a stale registration that has |

   |       | progressed slowly in the network and was passed by a more |

   |       | recent one.  It could also indicate a ROVR collision.



Pascal > If we say that Value is the 6Lo status we want 128 + 3, and get 13=
1..  I think that's the point we wanted to make.

Dec  Hex       Oct        Bin

    131 83         203       10000011



Pascal > Same here, am I missing something here? Any comments?



[RJ] But the 6lo value is applicable only when 'A' bit is set. With 'A' bit=
 unset, as is the case above, RPL is free to choose its own values for the =
remaining 6bits. Isn't it? I was assuming that the 6-bit registry will not =
be common between 6lo Status Code and RPL Status Code.





Take care,



Pascal

[RJ] Currently ND has 8bits to store 256 values ... RPL needs to carry
the same 8-bits but currently it has space only for 6-bits in RPL
Status field. But as of now only few values of ND status has been used
and using up 256 values (or for that matter 64 values) seem
far-stretched.
Thus one of the opinions is to limit the ND status to 64-bits and
carry as-is in the RPL status.

Subject: RE: [Roll] Unaware-leaves - ND-Status and RPL-Status linkage


True, we could.



Note that we might understand the =93A=94 bit differently. For me the flag =
means that the definition of the value is inherited from a 6lo spec, it doe=
s not mean that in runtime the status was imported from a 6lo message.



Now if the node moves to a different root that is attached to a different 6=
BBR, it will get 1100 0011 which is 195. If the node moves within the same =
root, the code will be whatever we decide here. Does the node really care w=
hich case that is?



Maybe we could use 195 as opposed to 130?


[RJ] Sorry, but I don't get this. Value 195 is a 6lo value i.e., the 'A' bi=
t (2nd MSB) is set. The DCO-draft talks primarily about values when 'A' bit=
 is not set i.e., about RPL related values only. The DCO draft normatively =
refers to unaware-leaves for values with 'A' bit set and for the definition=
 of 'A' bit itself.

My understanding is, if a common ancestor node within RPL Instance generate=
s DCO then the value is 130 ('A' bit is unset). If the DCO is generated bec=
ause of 6lo operations (across 6BBR) then the value could be 195 ('A' bit s=
et and lower 6-bits according to 6lo). Thus 130 value is ok in DCO-draft (i=
n ROLL). Unaware-draft will talk about value 195.









2. RPL status code for DCO (currently 130)
RPL Status code of 130 in DCO indicates that the address has moved i.e., so=
mewhere below/downstream in the sub-dodag the target has changed parents.

It was discussed that 130 may not be an appropriate value but when I checke=
d again it seems all right.

 0
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|E|A|  Value    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

130 =3D=3D 1000 0010

The E bit is set indicate rejection and A bit is unset to indicate non-ND v=
alue.

Thus 130 seems to be the right value.

Action Point? No change if this rationale is correct.



Pascal >  Moved is 3 in 6lo (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8505)



       3   | Moved: The registration failed because it is not the most |

   |       | recent.  This Status indicates that the registration is   |

   |       | rejected because another more recent registration was     |

   |       | done, as indicated by the same ROVR and a more recent     |

   |       | TID.  One possible cause is a stale registration that has |

   |       | progressed slowly in the network and was passed by a more |

   |       | recent one.  It could also indicate a ROVR collision.



Pascal > If we say that Value is the 6Lo status we want 128 + 3, and get 13=
1..  I think that=92s the point we wanted to make.

Dec  Hex       Oct        Bin

    131 83         203       10000011



Pascal > Same here, am I missing something here? Any comments?



[RJ] But the 6lo value is applicable only when 'A' bit is set. With 'A' bit=
 unset, as is the case above, RPL is free to choose its own values for the =
remaining 6bits. Isn't it? I was assuming that the 6-bit registry will not =
be common between 6lo Status Code and RPL Status Code.





Take care,



Pascal

&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; (as indicated by Pascal before). But to limit =
ND ARO status to 64bits<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; we need to convince the 6lo/6MAN group that &q=
uot;because of RPL&quot; we need to<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; reduce the size. I am not sure if this is easy=
 to digest!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I thought that we had 6-bits to store 64-values, while ND has 8-bits t=
o store<br>
&gt; 256 values.&nbsp; Please correct me if I mis-understood.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
[RJ] Currently ND has 8bits to store 256 values ... RPL needs to carry<br>
the same 8-bits but currently it has space only for 6-bits in RPL<br>
Status field. But as of now only few values of ND status has been used<br>
and using up 256 values (or for that matter 64 values) seem<br>
far-stretched.<br>
Thus one of the opinions is to limit the ND status to 64-bits and<br>
carry as-is in the RPL status.</span></font></p>

That's the point in my first sentence Rahul. If all we want to carry is mov=
ed then we can use the 6lo status, no need to invent another value.
We need to invent values for RPL specific stuff only. Here it makes the lif=
e of the device easier if there's a single code for moved unless we need to=
 know the difference

Subject: RE: [Roll] Unaware-leaves - ND-Status and RPL-Status linkage


True, we could.



Note that we might understand the "A" bit differently. For me the flag mean=
s that the definition of the value is inherited from a 6lo spec, it does no=
t mean that in runtime the status was imported from a 6lo message.



Now if the node moves to a different root that is attached to a different 6=
BBR, it will get 1100 0011 which is 195. If the node moves within the same =
root, the code will be whatever we decide here. Does the node really care w=
hich case that is?



Maybe we could use 195 as opposed to 130?



[RJ] Sorry, but I don't get this. Value 195 is a 6lo value i.e., the 'A' bi=
t (2nd MSB) is set. The DCO-draft talks primarily about values when 'A' bit=
 is not set i.e., about RPL related values only. The DCO draft normatively =
refers to unaware-leaves for values with 'A' bit set and for the definition=
 of 'A' bit itself.

My understanding is, if a common ancestor node within RPL Instance generate=
s DCO then the value is 130 ('A' bit is unset). If the DCO is generated bec=
ause of 6lo operations (across 6BBR) then the value could be 195 ('A' bit s=
et and lower 6-bits according to 6lo). Thus 130 value is ok in DCO-draft (i=
n ROLL). Unaware-draft will talk about value 195.









2. RPL status code for DCO (currently 130)
RPL Status code of 130 in DCO indicates that the address has moved i.e., so=
mewhere below/downstream in the sub-dodag the target has changed parents.

It was discussed that 130 may not be an appropriate value but when I checke=
d again it seems all right.

 0
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|E|A|  Value    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

130 =3D=3D 1000 0010

The E bit is set indicate rejection and A bit is unset to indicate non-ND v=
alue.

Thus 130 seems to be the right value.

Action Point? No change if this rationale is correct.



Pascal >  Moved is 3 in 6lo (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8505)



       3   | Moved: The registration failed because it is not the most |

   |       | recent.  This Status indicates that the registration is   |

   |       | rejected because another more recent registration was     |

   |       | done, as indicated by the same ROVR and a more recent     |

   |       | TID.  One possible cause is a stale registration that has |

   |       | progressed slowly in the network and was passed by a more |

   |       | recent one.  It could also indicate a ROVR collision.



Pascal > If we say that Value is the 6Lo status we want 128 + 3, and get 13=
1..  I think that's the point we wanted to make.

Dec  Hex       Oct        Bin

    131 83         203       10000011



Pascal > Same here, am I missing something here? Any comments?



[RJ] But the 6lo value is applicable only when 'A' bit is set. With 'A' bit=
 unset, as is the case above, RPL is free to choose its own values for the =
remaining 6bits. Isn't it? I was assuming that the 6-bit registry will not =
be common between 6lo Status Code and RPL Status Code.





Take care,



Pascal

[RJ] Currently ND has 8bits to store 256 values ... RPL needs to carry
the same 8-bits but currently it has space only for 6-bits in RPL
Status field. But as of now only few values of ND status has been used
and using up 256 values (or for that matter 64 values) seem
far-stretched.
Thus one of the opinions is to limit the ND status to 64-bits and
carry as-is in the RPL status.

&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt; WG?&nbsp; &gt; (I would have parsed ND sta=
tus as being someing 6man takes care<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt; of)<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt; Yes, or mandate that the 64 first Status v=
alues are reserved for stuff<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt; that could be carried in RPL<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RJ&gt; Wondering how such a mandate would work. IF =
we do it this way,<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RJ&gt; future extensions to ND ARO status need to c=
onsider whether they are<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RJ&gt; applicable to RPL and define accordingly. Th=
is implies familiarity in<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RJ&gt; 6lo/6MAN with RPL.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; I prefer the other approach where we restrict =
the ND ARO status to<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; 64bits itself. Anyways using 128 bits in the f=
uture seems far-fetched<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; (as indicated by Pascal before). But to limit =
ND ARO status to 64bits<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; we need to convince the 6lo/6MAN group that &q=
uot;because of RPL&quot; we need to<br>
&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; reduce the size. I am not sure if this is easy=
 to digest!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I thought that we had 6-bits to store 64-values, while ND has 8-bits t=
o store<br>
&gt; 256 values.&nbsp; Please correct me if I mis-understood.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
[RJ] Currently ND has 8bits to store 256 values ... RPL needs to carry<br>
the same 8-bits but currently it has space only for 6-bits in RPL<br>
Status field. But as of now only few values of ND status has been used<br>
and using up 256 values (or for that matter 64 values) seem<br>
far-stretched.<br>
Thus one of the opinions is to limit the ND status to 64-bits and<br>
carry as-is in the RPL status.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

Dear all :

As you may know, draft-ietf-roll-unaware-leaves is blocking the whole clust=
er C130 https://www.rfc-editor.org/cluster_info.php?cid=3DC310 and we want =
to ship it now (WG milestone: Mar 2020 - Initial submission). The issue we =
have with it is the fact that we allow encapsulate the ARO status in a RPL =
status and we need bits to signal that.

To free the necessary bits the proposal on the table is to reduce the possi=
ble values for the ARO status to 0-63.
This can be done by a simple IANA action that can be taken from draft-ietf-=
roll-unaware-leaves but we wanted to ensure that both ROLL and 6lo agree wi=
th the proposal:


12.1.  Resizing the ARO Status values

   IANA is requested to modify the Address Registration Option Status
   Values Registry as follows: The unassigned values range is reduced
   from 11-255 to 11-63.


NB: this will free 2 bits in the Extended Address Registration Option and t=
he Extended Duplicate Address Message, could become handy in the future.

Is there an issue with this that we are missing?

Pascal

Dear all,

The proposed update is fine with us (Shwetha and Carles), considering the
53 ARO status values that would still be available. There appear to be no
backwards issues either.

Would anyone in the 6Lo WG (or anyone receiving this email) have any
concerns with the proposal below by Pascal and folks?

If yes, please do chime in!

Thanks,

Shwetha and Carles

COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for addressing my last Discuss point!

It's interesting that COSE has us say what key type to use with
a given curve but JOSE doesn't have that in the registry, even though
it is still a relevant question.  I think we can trust [CURVE-REPRESENTATIONS]
to cover that topic, though.

I gave some brief thought to whether the usage of [CURVE-REPRESENTATIONS]
as the reference for the registry entries requires listing it as a normative reference
for this document, and decided that the current (informative) status is tolerable.

To answer a question that was raised in a different thread, I think the
part that made me most uncertain of the intended semantics here was the
"all bits" part -- there's a tendency to extrapolate to "all bits with
defined semantic meaning", but of course as discussed in the new text you
added, which bits will have semantic meaning can change with
refragmentation.  It might be possible to specify "all 32 bits set to one"
to avoid this risk of misinterpretation, but the current formulation of the
document leaves the concept of bitmap more general when "FULL bitmap" is
defined, and allows for future expansion, so I'm inclined to say that the
current text in the -16 is good and should stay as-is.

This is good, thanks.
I guess this means that a recipient of a "bitmap with as many bits set as
fragments have been sent but not all bits set" has to assume that
refragmentation has occurred and that the full datagram is not acknowledged
yet, which is fine.

Those alliances specify a particular bundle of functionalities from a bunch of RFCs and build their compliance tests on that. If Thread decides that the RFRAGs are used, then all the nodes are capable of it.

I see your point, but we are also in theory supposed to consider the IAB's
guidance from RFC 8170, including among other things incremental
deployability.  So my inclination is to include a brief note that since
deployments are expected to be managed and homogeneous, incremental
transition requires a flag day.

I just did not expect that people would reuse the seq for a larger fragment in which case there may be an issue. I just hope people did not implement that piece yet.

This sounds good, thanks.

It did occur to me while reading the diff that we do treat the fragment
with sequence 0 specially, and I didn't fully think through the
possibilities if it is that first packet that is "too long" and needs to be
subdivided.  There may be special considerations for the initial fragment
where it gets some special handling, and though I suspect that there are
not any real problems here, and in any case the datagram itself could be
re-sent, I mention it just in case there are some new problems (e.g., we
get stuck in a case where we have to send something that gets treated as a
reset even if we don't want it to).

It is expected that there will be overlaps and now gaps in the acknowledgements. The FULL bitmap (all ones) is the indicator that enough was received without ambiguity and regardless of which fragments were used.

Agreed that the FULL bitmap should be a clear sign that "all data is
received"

Thanks,

Ben

Thanks.  (I know the diagram is a bit tight on space, so I can understand

That seems to cover it, though of course there are the usual potential
security considerations if it doesn't check, which IIRC are in the
companion document now.

Hmm, the -16 is showing this still as "sender", not "recipient" (maybe

I'm not really sure what text to change, either, unfortunately.
The only thing that really comes to mind would be to drop "positively", but
that might have drawbacks of its own.

Sounds good ("creating the path" is important; "in-order" less so).

Well I feel silly for missing that and blindly applying the comparison

That should work well (though I expect the RFC Editor to tweak the wording

The whole text is written with the assumption of a single interface because that's usually the case in 6LoWPAN but at least there could be more than one MAC sued as source by this node in parallel for difference datagrams. A node must remember which MAC addresses it uses for a datagram and that's part of the key used as index for the rfrag ack. I revisited the text a bit.

Ah, that makes sense.  I think I had envisoned the datagram_tag as being
global to the node, across all interfaces and MAC addresses, but there's
not a reason to do so (and in fact reason to not do so, as you discuss
somewhere about how to cope with the limited 8-bit space).

Yup, given the MAC-layer protection an attacker that can do this can do
more interesting (read: harmful) things.

I couldn't see anything either, but it resembles an edge case that we like
to double-check.  So, thanks for double-checking :)

That looks good.  The only thing I'd consider adding is another clause at
the very end, ", as the fragmentation protocol does not include any native
security mechanisms".  But it's up to you.

I think I was considering that the node that's supposed to send the ack
could decline to do so for some reason, or send spontaneous acks.  But "no
contest" here.

:)
Must be my chemistry degree at work...

> We transmit at most 1 frame per interframe gap. So the number of interframe gaps per RTT gives us the max number of frames that can be sent by RTT, that is till an ack comes in. So we fill the network with the number given, any more than that is a potential addition to the bloat but to no added throughput.

COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for addressing my comments!
Just a few minor notes from reading the diff from -13 to -16:

Section 1

   each hop, more in Section 6.  This specification encodes the
   Datagram_Tag in one byte, which will saturate if more than 256
   datagram transit in the fragmented form over a same hop at the same
   time.  This is not realistic at the time of this writing.  Should

Some grammar nit(s) here, maybe: "datagrams transit in fragmented form
over a single hop at the same time"

Section 4.3

   is out of scope.  In most cases, the expectation is that most
   datagrams will represent only a few fragments, and that only the last

Maybe s/represent/require/?

   fragment will be acknowledged.  A basic implementation of the
   fragmenting endpoint is NOT REQUIRED to variate the size of the

nit: s/variate/vary/

   the ECN signal or simply reset the window to 1 (see Appendix C for
   more) till the end of this datagram upon detecting a congestion.

nit: s/till/until/

Section 5

   This document specifies an alternate to the 6LoWPAN fragmentation

nit: s/alternate/alternative/

Section 5.1

It just occurred to me now that with the change in response to my
initial review of "never reuse a sequence number for a fragment with
different size", there may be special considerations for the initial
fragment (Sequence 0) that gets some special handling.  I suspect there
are not any real problems here, and in any case the datagram itself
could be re-sent, but mention it just in case there are some new
problems (e.g., we get stuck in a case where we have to send something
that gets treated as a reset even if we don't want it to).

Appendix C

   represented in Figure 4 in Section 5.2.  While the support of echoing
   the ECN at the reassembling endpoint in mandatory, this specification
   does not provide the flow control mechanism that react to the
   congestion at the fragmenting endpoint.  A minimalistic behaviour
   could be to reset the window to 1 so the fragments are sent and
   acknowledged one by one till the end of the datagram.

I think we may be suffering from a bit of skew here, since Section 1
specifies the "UseECN=yes" behavior (for this document) as "reset the
window to 1".

The IESG has approved the following document:
- 'Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks'
  (draft-ietf-6lo-ap-nd-20.txt) as Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the IPv6 over Networks of
Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group.

The IESG contact persons are Éric Vyncke and Suresh Krishnan.

A URL of this Internet Draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-ap-nd/





Technical Summary

  This document specifies an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery
   (ND) protocol defined in RFC6775 and updated in RFC8505.  The new
   extension is called Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and
   it protects the owner of an address against address theft and
   impersonation attacks in a low-power and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes
   supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-
   ID) and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The
   Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be
   used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once
   an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership
   is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the
   registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address
   Validation.

Working Group Summary

 This draft has been extensively discussed in 6lo and some of the crypto experts. Following a workgroup discussion on crypto in the draft and given the nature of crypto expertise required :
 - Rene Struik joined as an author in -08 to help with the crypto details.
 - Russ Housley reviewed -08 and suggested following directions for removing HashEdDSA  based on the decisions in RFC 8410 and RFC 8419 and curdle wg discussion.
 - version 09 of the draft was updated to reference PureEdDSA (instead of earlier EdDSA25519ph). Additional sub-section  Implementation Attacks was added to the Security consideration.
 - version 10 additional updates on the security processing, new security considerations, and organized  3 different schemes for the crypto computation : mixing  NIST P-256   and  Curve25519 (for the curves and   ECDSA and Ed25519) for the signature algorithms, associated with either SHA-256 or SHA-512 for the hash function.
- version 11 as part of shepherd review found that ND option definition can be made explicit, this resulted in the latest version 12.

Document Quality

There are no implementations, but there are vendors have indicated plans to build 6lo defined backbone router as a product that would lead to adoption of this ND extensions.

Thanks for adding this. However, as I said a couple of times in my =
discuss there must be more guidance. This is not only about flow control =
but also about congestion control and it is not okay to declare =
congestion control out of scope. If you only do fragmentation but no =
retransmission, you don=E2=80=99t need to care about congestion control =
(but only flow control) as you don=E2=80=99t increase the actual network =
load by this. However, if you retransmit you are sending more data than =
the original sender (that hopefully is congestion controlled) and =
therefore you increase the load on the network and you MUST implement =
your own congestion control or some fixed rate limiting for that =
additional load. Saying this is out of scope and you want to do =
experimentation is not acceptable for a Proposed Standard.

To be clear the request of this discuss is to give a normative =
recommendation for the default value of the window size and/or =
inter-frame gap.

Further note, as you allow to adapt both the window and the inter-frame =
gap dynamically, you actually implement two control mechanisms here. I =
actually recommend to only use the inter-frame gap and don=E2=80=99t =
have window here. You say a couple of times in your reply below, that =
the window determines the ask-rate, however, it is not clear to me =
because the ack rate should be a parameter at the receiver and not at =
the sender (maybe I don=E2=80=99t remember things correctly because =
it=E2=80=99s a while back since I read the draft and I couple find =
anything about this in the draft quickly). If the window size however =
does define the ack rate, then maybe you should rename that parameter =
respectively.

However, if there is really a need for a window, I still recommend to =
talk less about adapting this value dynamically and make clear that =
having a fixed value is the recommended default. Therefore I recommend =
to remove the parameter MinWindowSize and MaxWindowSize because these =
should actually not be parameters than can be configured but are actual =
bounds. If someone decides to implement dynamic window adaption, they =
can decide to re-introduce these parameter again and make them =
configurable but it doesn=E2=80=99t need to be part of this spec.

So it could be something like:

"Window_Size:  Window_Size MUST be at least 1 and less than 33. If the =
inter-frame gap is selected large enough to not overload the path and =
the one-way delay is known, the Window_Size SHOULD be set to the one-way =
trip time divided by the inter-frame gap.  Otherwise a small value of X =
SHOULD be configured. Note that the Window_Size determines the ack rate. =
If the window_size is set this to 32, this means only the last Fragment =
is acknowledged in the first round. If it is set to a smaller value, =
more acks are generated but the load on the forward path will be lower. =
Window_Size MAY be adapted dynamically to reduce load on the forward =
path in case of congestion.=E2=80=9D

Still you also need to say more about how to set and dynamically adapt =
the inter-frame gap because that is probably the real limiting fact to =
avoid network overload.

Also below you remove the recommendation for using the number of hops as =
window size but here you added it again. This is just incorrect. There =
is no dependency between the number of hops and the window size: If =
there is no bottleneck on the path, you can just send with line rate at =
the sender. If there is a bottleneck on the path and you send at a =
higher rate than the bottleneck than soon or later the buffer at that =
hop will fill up completely. So the window size depends only on the =
bottleneck rate and end-to-end delay (BDP) (which let=E2=80=99s you =
calculate the number of packet in flight) plus the buffer size at the =
bottleneck. The number of hops is irrelevant.

Dear all,

As you know, the exceptional situation due to COVID-19 led to cancelling
the in-person IETF 107 meeting.

As a replacement for the 6Lo WG session that was originally scheduled for
IETF 107, we plan to hold a virtual interim 6Lo WG meeting. As recommended
by the IESG, we plan to hold the virtual meeting on Monday, 27th of April
(at a time yet to be determined, and with further details to be provided).

Please send your requests for agenda items to the chairs by Thursday, 26th
of March. Please provide us with the following information:

- Draft name
- Presenter name
- Expected duration
- Objective of the discussion

As usual, we will need minute takers. Please do not hesitate to volunteer!

Should you have any comments or questions, please let us know.

Thanks,

Shwetha and Carles

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : 6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery
        Author          : Pascal Thubert
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-18.txt
	Pages           : 31
	Date            : 2020-03-19

Abstract:
   This draft updates RFC 4944 with a simple protocol to recover
   individual fragments across a route-over mesh network, with a minimal
   flow control to protect the network against bloat.


The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery/

There are also htmlized versions available at:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-18
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-18

A diff from the previous version is available at:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-18


Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Yes but with only =E2=80=9Cone hop=E2=80=9D/the network you are =

Dropping to 1 on CE mark is fine. However, when do you increase the =
window again? If you want to say something here, you have to specify =
that as well.

That=E2=80=99s an option as well. Again when you reduce something you =
might as well need to specify when to increase it again and that means =
you are specifying basically a congestion control scheme.

So how do you currently set the IFG? Both IFG and window_size can be =

Using a window would be a window-based congestion control. Using the IFG =
would be a rate-based congestion control. But the principle is the same.

In the example of 6TiSCH, an rfrag_ack consumes the exact same bandwidth =

I've done some adaptive CIR long ago in IBM FR switches and it can be =

window-based flow control. And it really depends on the relay doing the =

I see that the idea was rather to get the frames flowing (that avoiding =

However, in this case you don=E2=80=99t really need the window at all =

This is a bit the part that I don=E2=80=99t understand fully. Why do you =

having one.

You already have the IFG. What's the benefits of having a window based =

I think you need to provide some (normative) recommendation for the =

If having the window is still useful, this is fine I think.

Hi Pascal,

Okay! :-)

About the use of ECN, I agree as you say there should only be a few =
fragments and not increasing might be okay. However, you would need to =
clarify that the window is reset for each new datagram, I guess, right? =
Also I don=E2=80=99t think you necessarily need to reduce to 1 on CE =
marking but maybe halve the window or something. Or you leave this open =
like =E2=80=9CIf an E flag is received the window SHOULD be reduced, at =
least by 1 and at max to 1. Halving the window for each E flag received, =
could be a good compromise but needs further experimentation.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=A6

I wonder if it would be good to say a bit more about the recommended =
values for the window size, as I think 32 will usually in most network =
not limit transmission (and the limiting value will be IFG) while with a =
size of 3, that's very conservative to not overload the network (and =
will be slow than the limits induced by IFG). Is my understanding =
correct?

Mirja

Hi Pascal,

The proposed text below and in your previous email look good! Thanks!

I would appreciate and recommend to add also a shorter version of your =
good explanation below to make the reader better understand which factor =
is the limiting one when using a certain parameter setting and =
respectively which factor could be tuned if any dynamic adaptation is =
implemented.

Thanks!
Mirja

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : 6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery
        Author          : Pascal Thubert
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-20.txt
	Pages           : 32
	Date            : 2020-03-20

Abstract:
   This draft updates RFC 4944 with a protocol to forward individual
   fragments across a route-over mesh and recover them end-to-end, with
   congestion control capabilities to protect the network.


The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is:

Hi Pascal,

Not too much more to say, here, fortunately :)
Though it perhaps makes me more sorry that I was slow in responding...

Also, it has to do with the 6LoWPAN compression that is not the same at intermediate hops, so it's not really an MTU issue. Note that this may have weird implications like an intermediate node generates a 'final' fragment in addition to the original ones. The win becomes a loss because a whole additional frame is sent.

In particular there's a need to indicate that any FF solution MUST swap the datagram_tag at each hop ans interleave space between fragments on radios.

So we ended up with the decision to have 2 specs, one that changes RFC 4944 and one that does not and we figured that the one that does not was pure implementation so it went to LWIG. And we figured that there was an over arching spec that any draft, LWIG or new std track , has in common so we extracted that, and then there were 3. Initially the over-arching (this) was informational but we concluded with Suresh in Singapore that 1) the additions from Dave's review made it an Standard Track and 2) that the fragment recovery needed a normative reference to include the normative text in this.

Thanks for the extra background; it helps me understand how we got to where
we are now.

This helps, though one might be slightly confused that the "endpoints" are
not the packet source and destination.  But I don't have an easy solution
for that...

That seems reasonable.  IIRC, my understanding at the time was that this
scenario would only arise when fragmentation was performed at a different
node than the original sender of the IP packet, which I expect to be rare
in homogeneous LPWANs.

It seems like the best we can do, so it had better be OK :)

Hmm, talking about a "larger size of the datagram_tag" (or wait, did we end
up at "Datagram_Tag"?) feels odd since this document has fixed it at 16
bits.  Maybe:

   *  Attacks based on predictable fragment identification values are
      also possible but can be avoided.  The datagram_tag SHOULD be
      assigned pseudo-randomly in order to reduce the risk of such attacks.
      Nonetheless, some level of risk remains that an attacker able to
      authenticate to and send traffic on the network can guess a valid
      Datagram_Tag value, since there are only 2^16 possible values.

Maybe s/should already be inside/needs to participate in (i.e.,
authenticate to) the LLN in order/, but this does help clarify.

Thank you for addressing my Discuss (and Comment) points!

In the security considerations, perhaps "fragment 1" would be
better as "first-fragment" to avoid questions of zero- vs. one-indexing.

Hi Pascal,

Thanks for this additional text. I just cleared my discuss.

A couple of nits you/Suresh maybe want to add as RFC editor note:

OLD
Note that the action upon detecting a congestion only applies till the =
end of the datagram
NEW
Note that the action upon detecting congestion only applies till the end =
of the datagram.
MAYBE EVEN
Note that any action that has been performed upon detection of =
congestion only applies for the transmission of one datagram

OLD
an inter-frame gap can be as a flow control or a congestion control =
measure
NEW
The inter-frame gap can be used as a flow control or a congestion =
control measure

OLD
a conservative Window_Size of, say, 3, will be the gating factor that =
starves the sender
MAYBE
a conservative Window_Size of, say, 3, will be the gating factor that =
limits the transmission rate of the sender

Hi Pascal,

This also looks good to me; I'll just leave a few minor comments here
before returning to the other thread.

If the registering node loses a 6BBR,  it should reregister to another (that's an obvious), and if it is registered to multiple 6BBRs, it should refresh the other registrations with a new TID (text needed). We have no design for a registered node using multiple registering node, and that's worth mentioning too.

I think that the "authenticating a node that attaches [...]" is meant to
apply to the LLN links, and perhaps the backbone provides the protection
against rogue access by physical access protection?  Maybe we need two
clauses after the comma, e.g., "on the LLN by [...], and on the backbone by
[...]".

This is nice!  I am still not sure about how much a deployment needs to
care about concurrency and/or consistency issues for the "distributed
database"; given that lossy radio technologies are involved I mostly assume
that things will be self-healing in the face of a bit of delayed update
propagation, but it would be nice to have that confirmed.

That collision could not happen before, there was no classical ND on the LLN, and a remote 6LBR would be on a different subnet. So we had to specify a new beast, a 6LBR that can reside on the backbone, and how it plays with classical ND. So I do not see a for backwards compatibility/incremental deployment issue with the 6LBR on the backbone, it's a new beast, there was none before.

Oh, I hadn't expected 802.11 to full into the "LLN" bucket, but now that I
know that the sentence works fine.

I guess I wasn't sure if those mechanisms would be 100% reliable to avoid
two nodes thinking they have the same address, but it's been too long since
I wrote this for me to be sure what I was thinking.  If you say they are
100% reliable, that is good enough for me.

I was thinking something like:

  The procedures in this document modify the mechanisms used for IPv6 ND
  and DAD and should not affect other aspects of IPv6 or
  higher-level-protocol operation.  As such, the main classes of attacks
  that are in play are those which week to block neighbor discovery or to
  forcibly claim an address that another node is attempting to use.  In the
  absence of cryptographic protection at higher layers, the latter class of
  attacks can have significant consequences, with the attacker being able
  to read all the "stolen" traffic that was directed to the target of the
  attack.

It's probably obvious, yes.  At this point I'm never sure where the line is
for "too obvious to mention"; some things are obvious to me but
far-from-obvious to people who haven't had a couple years' experience as
SEC AD...

Hmm, this probably relates to my comment in the other thread.  There may
not be anything else to say, indeed.

Sorry I confused you. For a packet sourced in the Internet, the border rout=
er does the compression at the ingress of the 6LoWPAN network. So it is not=
 the original sender. But it is both the 6LoWPAN endpoint and the fragmenti=
ng endpoint.

Hum, not this doc but RFC 4944 which is described page 6.=20
"
Section 5.3 of
   [RFC4944] defines the format of the header for the first and
   subsequent fragments.  All fragments are tagged with a 16-bit
   "Datagram_Tag", used to identify which packet each fragment belongs
"
This doc does not impose anything per se, e.g. fragment recovery inherits f=
rom this but uses a smaller tag.

Nice, I'd just change " only 2^16" with " a limited number of" to keep it g=
eneric

I'm continuing with your other mails based on -14.

Keep safe;

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multihop IPv6 Network
        Authors         : Thomas Watteyne
                          Pascal Thubert
                          Carsten Bormann
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-15.txt
	Pages           : 14
	Date            : 2020-03-23

Abstract:
   This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of
   6LoWPAN fragment over a route-over network.  Forwarding fragments can
   improve both the end-to-end latency and reliability, and reduce the
   buffer requirements in intermediate nodes; it may be implemented
   using RFC 4944 and virtual reassembly buffers.

To do care and this is why we have the ROVR and the TID included in the exc=
hange on the backbone.
The point is to ensure that the database is maintained up to date with the =
right state at the right place.
This db becomes a core functionality for a modern switch and router as it i=
s the point where the hosts are observed.
This is injected in many features, such as LISP MS/MR, SD-stuff, network ma=
nagement and security tools.

Classical IPv6 ND DAD is NOT 100% reliable. It is in fact very unreliable o=
n large wireless deployments.
Anything that happens on the backbone that is based on multicast may have m=
isses.=20
What makes IPv6 work is that the collisions actually do not happen with pse=
udo-random, crypto-based or MAC-seeded IIDs.
The next spec on having a 6LBR on the backbone will make it reliable, provi=
ded that the 6LBR itself is. But getting 6MAN to endorse it will be an inte=
resting time, help appreciated.

Cool, using it. At some point you become an author!

And I probably know my spec too well. Let's go then. What about uplifting t=
he below:

"
   This specification introduces a 6BBR that is a router on the path of
   the LLN traffic and a 6LBR that is used for the lookup.  They could
   be interesting targets for an attacker.  A compromised 6BBR can
   accept a registration but block the traffic, or refrain from
   proxying.  A compromised 6LBR may accept unduly the transfer of
   ownership of an address, or block a new comer by faking that its
   address is a duplicate.  But those attacks are possible in a
   classical network from a compromised default router and a DHCP
   server, respectively, and can be prevented using the same methods.
"


Again, many, many thanks Benjamin : )

Since these are limited changes I'll post a single update with Mirja's comm=
ents as well.

Keep safe!

Abstract:
   This document updates RFC 6775 and RFC 8505 in order to enable proxy
   services for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery by Routing Registrars called
   Backbone Routers.  Backbone Routers are placed along the wireless
   edge of a Backbone, and federate multiple wireless links to form a
   single Multi-Link Subnet.

The IESG has approved the following document:
- 'On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multihop IPv6 Network'
  (draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-15.txt) as Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the IPv6 over Networks of
Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group.

The IESG contact persons are Éric Vyncke and Suresh Krishnan.

A URL of this Internet Draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/





Technical Summary

   This document introduces the capability to forward 6LoWPAN fragments.
   This method reduces the latency and increases end-to-end reliability
   in route-over forwarding.  It is the companion to using virtual
   reassembly buffers which is a pure implementation technique.


Working Group Summary

The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. The present document is the second one. This decision had good consensus, and the present document was created and has progressed with no controversy. Only after the review of -04 by the INTDIR assigned reviewer (Dave Thaler), and subsequent discussion with the authors, it has become clear that some content of the document had to mandate protocol behavior, thus the Intended Status of Proposed Standard.

Document Quality

Yasuyuki Tanaka, Georgios Papadopoulos and Dominique Barthel carried out deep reviews. The last two were carried out during WGLC, and the comments were addressed in draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-02. Dave Thaler reviewed -04, on behalf of the INTDIR, and subsequent discussion with the authors led to adding normative text to the document and changing its intended status from Informational to Proposed Standard. There exist implementations of the fragment forwarding technique that avoids per-hop reassembly.

Personnel

The Document Shepherd is Carles Gomez. The Responsible AD is Suresh Krishnan

Hi Pascal,
  I went through the latest rev and found an off-by-one error on the =
Fragment size.

* Section 5.1.

   Fragment_Size:  10-bit unsigned integer; the size of this fragment in
      a unit that depends on the Link-Layer technology.  Unless
      overridden by a more specific specification, that unit is the
      byte, which allows fragments up to 1024 bytes.

Shouldn=E2=80=99t this be fragments upto *1023* bytes instead of 1024 =
bytes?

Thanks
Suresh

Ah, I think you are right about my confusion.

I can see why you were confused at this remark; it's ... pretty opaque!

I was reacting to "zero-trust security" -- we still have to trust the
routers to do the right thing, so my knee-jerk reaction is to not apply
"zero-trust" to them.

The IESG has approved the following document:
- 'IPv6 Backbone Router'
  (draft-ietf-6lo-backbone-router-20.txt) as Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the IPv6 over Networks of
Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group.

The IESG contact persons are Éric Vyncke and Suresh Krishnan.

A URL of this Internet Draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-backbone-router/





Technical Summary

  This document updates RFC 6775 and RFC 8505 in order to enable proxy
   services for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery by Routing Registrars called
   Backbone Routers.  Backbone Routers are placed along the wireless
   edge of a Backbone, and federate multiple wireless links to form a
   single MultiLink Subnet.

Working Group Summary

This draft has evolved from early days of 6lo group and has gone through
13 iterations as a workgroup draft since 2016. It has received and incorporated
reviews from 6lo, ROLL, RPL and 6man experts. 
 

Document Quality

A prototype implementation exists in closed source (Cisco IOS).
One major vendor has indicated plans to implement the draft in
shipping product. 

The document required a detailed review from 6man that was done and version -13 
was updated with the comments received. 

Personnel

The Document shepherd is Shwetha Bhandari. The Responsible AD is Suresh Krishnan.

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">DISCUSS:</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">-----------------------------------------=
-----------------------------</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">In general, I'm worried that this documen=
t is so unreadable that I can't give it a proper review.&nbsp; I just don't=
 have a clear picture of how all the pieces fit together, and which pieces =
are new as opposed to reused from other
specifications.&nbsp; That said, here are my notes as they stand at present=
.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Many thanks for your DISCUSS and COMMENTs, but I believe that the IPv6=
 by using NFC should be useful as one of the various 6lo technologies for s=
ome IoT applications and services. I hope you understand intention of this =
documents.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;"><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</fo=
nt></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">If I understand correctly, the statements=
 about &quot;distance of 10 cm or less&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;=
secure communications&quot; apply only for usage compliant with the relevan=
t legal regulations.&nbsp; We cannot expect attackers to abide by such
regulations, and large (directional) antennas and/or high-power transmitter=
s should be presumed to expand that distance by some factor, in adversarial=
 environments.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div>Partially agreed with your concern, so we can think of the larger ante=
nnas, but I don't think so. Even though the third attackers have large ante=
nnas, they cannot get any of information by using their large antennas from=
 my regular NFC antenna. If I have
large antennas with NFC, that's not secured. On the contrary, If I have reg=
ular antennas, such an attack is not going to be happening. NFC RF distance=
 is regularly less than 10cm. When I had the NFC RF with high-power transmi=
tters in my experiments, the RF
distance was less than maximum 1 m. IPv6 over NFC is actually the first try=
 in IETF 6lo WG, and the NFC was normally just used RFID-like style these d=
ays. So, many people who are not in the NFC technologies get wrong sometime=
s.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Section 4.3 should probably provide some =
guidance on choosing the PRF F().&nbsp; We are implicitly relying on RFC 72=
17 for a lot of things, some of which 7127 doesn't even cover, and the sugg=
ested construction in RFC</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">7127 may not still be best practice.</div=
>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>It is true that RFC7217 is not providing the prefect solution for NFC.=
 I will mention your concern in the next version of draft.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;"><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</fo=
nt></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">I don't understand why MIUX is not mandat=
ory (and thus we could get rid of all the &quot;FAR is NOT RECOMMENDED&quot=
; stuff).&nbsp; Is there known demand for</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">IPv6 over NFC on devices that cannot do M=
IUX?</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>I think this is good point. In the beginning stage, I also intended to=
 MIUX is just optional in this document (IPv6 over NFC). This means FAR can=
 be used sometimes if NFC devices do not support MIUX. In fact, the MIUX is=
 not mandatory but option in the
NFC MAC/PHY spec. However, 6lo experts has given me a lot of comments wheth=
er MIUX is going to be mandatory or not in this document. Finally, I have d=
ecided it mandatory. I believe that the MIUX can be mandatory for all NFC d=
evices if IPv6 over NFC is widely
used in the future. Therefore, this is OK I think.</div>

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Either the MIUX occupies 11 bits and ther=

gure are 1011 and there is only one unused bit (singular) to be marked as z=
ero.&nbsp; This needs to be more clear,
as right now I can't tell what's intended.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Agreed. I have changed them like this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; NFC LLCP is 2176 bytes including the 128 byte default of MIU. T=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">How does a device know that the link-loca=

<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Agreed. I put some more explanations at the end of the section 4.4 lik=
e this. (in version-15)</div>

this document, so they can talk to each other.</div>

-----------------------------</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">A lot of this document reads like marketi=
ng material for NFC, which is a bit off-putting in a technical specificatio=
n.&nbsp; (Some examples:</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&quot;outstanding performance&quot;, &quo=
t;NFC builds upon RFID systems by allowing two-way communication between en=
dpoints, where earlier systems such as contactless smart cards were one-way=
 only&quot;, &quot;NFC also has the strongest ability (e.g.,
secure communication distance of 10 cm) to prevent a third party from attac=
king privacy&quot;, &quot;NFC technology enables simple and safe two-way in=
teractions between electronic devices&quot;, &quot;NFC's bidirectional comm=
unication ability is ideal for establishing connections
with other technologies by the simplicity of touch&quot;, etc.)</div>

<div>You're right. It is &quot;The maximum value&quot;</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;"><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</fo=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; of the TLV Value field can b=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; NFC LLCP is 2176 bytes inclu=
ding the 128 byte default of MIU.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">How can we use all 128 bytes of MIU when =
we need to spend four bytes on the MIUX TLV?</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>So, I mentioned the field MUST be 0x480 for MTU of a IPv6 packet in th=
e previous answer.</div>

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">It's unclear to me what information I'm s=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;"><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</fo=

<div>So, I merged MAC/PHY of NFC in the figure 3 (in version -15).</div>

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Section 4.2</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; This document does NOT RECOM=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">nit: this isn't clear about what is simpl=

<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Because FAR for NFC is not required in document, it's simple. I have c=

<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Yes, they are unique between two devices.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">The writing here is hard to follow -- I'm=
 supposed to utilize the 6-bit NFC LLCP address to form an IID (with nothin=

and only finally at the end do we mention the RFC 7217 PRF (and not even by=

<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>So, I have changed them for clarification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the 6LN and 6LBR are directly conn=

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Duplicate Address Detection =

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp; When two or more NFC=
 6LNs(or 6LRs) meet, there are two cases.&nbsp; One</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that th=
ree or more NFC devices are linked with multi-hop</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connection=
s, and the other is that they meet within a single hop</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">I thought we said that NFC was a two-part=
y thing only.&nbsp; How are we getting multi-hop connections?&nbsp; If I as=
sume that this is talking about the IPv6 layer, how do we guarantee that on=
ly NFC-capable devices are participating in
the IPv6 network?</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>In this document, we said two topologies with NFC devices. One is only=
 two NFC devices connected, and the other is three or more NFC devices are =
connected as a mesh. Multi-hop connections of NFC devices are technically p=
ossible with IPv6 over NFC.</div>

<div>Agreed. I have removed the sentences, &quot;When the NFC nodes are not=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Section 5.1</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">This section is laying out the physical m=

<div>Agreed. I have removed the &quot;typical&quot;.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the key applications =
of using IPv6 over NFC is securely</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; transmitting IPv6 packets be=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; into the RF between them, it=
 must come to nearly touch them.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Or use a big and ungainly high-gain anten=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">This example does a little better than th=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">What is &quot;outstanding performance&quo=
t;?&nbsp; This doesn't seem actionable.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is not easy to find out examples of applications with IPv6 over NFC=
 because IPv6 over NFC is really brand-new from the IETF 6lo. But I believe=
 some of good applications will be developed. And I will get rid of the key=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; IPv6-over-NFC is, in practic=
e, not used for long-lived links for big</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; size data transfer or multim=

ent.&nbsp; This will mitigate the threat of</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; correlation of activities ov=
er time.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">This mitigation only occurs if the IID is=
 freshly generated for each link, which isn't mentioned until the next para=
graph, so it's an unsupported claim at this point in the text.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Before we considered RFC7217 in Section 4.3, we had security considera=
tions for the mitigation. In the final version, the consideration is not ne=
cessarily required. I have already removed the paragraph in section 7 (in v=
ersion -15).</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; IPv6-over-NFC uses an IPv6 i=
nterface identifier formed from a &quot;Short</div>

<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>It is &quot;such as&quot;. I think the part, &quot;and a set of well-k=

necessary in the final version. Thanks. I have removed the part.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; NFC link layer (LLC) is not =
generated as a physically permanent value</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; but logically generated for =

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; exploitation.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">These last two seem to have high overlap =
with the &quot;correlation of activities over time&quot; from the previous =
paragraph.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Agreed. I have removed them in the next version.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, this document does not=
 RECOMMEND sending NFC packets over the</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet or any unsecured ne=
twork.</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">I don't see any preceding argument that l=
eads into or supports this claim; why is the word &quot;thus&quot; present?=
</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Also, such a recommendation seems like it=
 should be more prominently made near the start of the document and not rel=
egated to the security considerations.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Agreed. I have removed &quot;Thus&quot; and move the sentence at the b=
eginning of the section</div>
<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">This document also does not give any indi=
cation of what might be considered to be a &quot;secure&quot; network.&nbsp=
; Note that per the RFC 3552 threat model, we generally do not place any tr=

<div><font face=3D"Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>Agreed. I have removed the last paragraph.</div>

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Section 9.2</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">Isn't the whole point of this work that y=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">How do you not need to implement NFC in o=

<div style=3D"padding-left:40pt;">&nbsp;</div>

The IESG has approved the following document:
- '6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery'
  (draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-21.txt) as Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the IPv6 over Networks of
Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group.

The IESG contact persons are Éric Vyncke and Suresh Krishnan.

A URL of this Internet Draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery/





Technical Summary

This document updates RFC 4944 with a simple protocol to recover
individual fragments across a route-over mesh network, with a minimal
flow control to protect the network against bloat.

Working Group Summary

Older versions of a precursor of this document existed as an individual submission discussed in the 6lowpan working group between 2008 and 2010, and were discussed again during the initial stages of the 6lo working group lifetime (e.g. at IETF 88). Some concerns were expressed at the time, such as potential interactions across layers. The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group again in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. This decision had good WG consensus, and no controversy has occurred since then regarding any of the three mentioned documents.

Document Quality

Michel Veillette carried out a thorough review of the document before it became a 6lo wg document.
Laurent Toutain and Carles Gomez, both with a background in fragmentation in constrained node networks, did comprehensive reviews of recent versions of the document, based on revisions -02 and -03, which led to revisions -03 and -04.  As a result of the shepherd (Carles Gomez) review, the document was again updated, leading to versions -05 and -06). Another WG participant provided comments in parallel, leading to the current version as of the writing (i.e. -07). One WG participant expressed on the mailing list that he was working on an implementation. His feedback contributed to improving the document.


Personnel

The Document Shepherd is Carles Gomez. The Responsible AD is Suresh Krishnan.



RFC Editor Note

OLD:
Unless overridden by a more specific specification, that unit is the
byte, which allows fragments up to 1024 bytes.

NEW:
Unless overridden by a more specific specification, that unit is the
byte, which allows fragments up to 1023 bytes.
