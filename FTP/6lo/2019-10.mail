Hi,

draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery states in section 6.3

[the] might need to abort the process of a fragmented packet for internal
> reasons, for instance if it [=E2=80=A6] considers that this packet is alr=
eady fully
> reassembled and passed to the upper layer. In that case, the receiver
> SHOULD indicate so to the sender with a NULL bitmap in a RFRAG
> Acknowledgment.


The given example seems to me the perfect instance to set a FULL bitmap
instead. There is no other instance were a FULL bitmap is specified to be
sent, except for the case that the datagram incidentally fills out the
whole value space of the sequence number field.

Or am I missing something?

Kind regards,
Martine

Hi Pascal,

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I think the text you added was exactly
what I was thinking and resolves all my comments.

<br>
It is not mentioned but as a proxy the 6BBR should send the MLD reports for=

Dear authors:

Please find some comments below.


<

    some IEEE 802.15.4 link
"
Please reword to "IEEE Std 802.15.4"  and include a reference. You may use

      <reference anchor=3D"IEEE802154">
         <front>
            <title>IEEE Std. 802.15.4, Part. 15.4: Wireless Medium Access

            <date/>
         </front>
      </reference>

Note that Thread and 6TiSCH use 6LoWPAN on 802.15.4 . This is worth mention=
ing. Thread has nice lighting use cases.


I do not see text on 802.11ah ? There has been 6lo work https://tools.ietf.=
org/html/draft-delcarpio-6lo-wlanah-01


Section 3.6 does not refer to the WIP on PLC: https://datatracker.ietf.org/=
doc/draft-hou-6lo-plc/


Shouldn't you have a section on Wi-Sun? see https://datatracker.ietf.org/do=
c/draft-heile-lpwan-wisun-overview/
Note that this is also related to RFC 8036 together with PLC, should also b=
e discussed next to your section .6. on Smart Grid





   "

   In the G3-PLC specification, the 6lo adaptation layer utilizes the

   6LoWPAN functions (e.g. header compression, fragmentation and

   reassembly)
      "
    Are you sure of that? I thought they used RFC 8066 to do their stuff

In section 5

"

      6LoWPAN requires that IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

      for low power networks [RFC6775<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6775>]=
 be used for autoconfiguration of

      stateless IPv6 address assignment.  Considering the energy

      sensitive networks [RFC6775<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6775>] mak=
es optimization from classical

      IPv6 ND [RFC4861<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861>] protocol.

"

This text is a bit off: On the one hand autoconf is defined in RFC 4862. On=
 the other hand RFC 8505 updates RFC 6775. It forgets to mention the obviou=
s, which is to must IPv6 (RFC 8200)
Then there's more to be said about the support of IPv6 by the 6lo node. E.g=
., support of host functions in RFC 8200 like the capability to ignore cons=
umed routing headers and HbH options. This become useful when combined with=
 RPL, and a ref to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo=
 would be useful.
I'd suggest:

"
      6LoWPAN developed a new version of IPv6 ND [RFC 4861, RFC 4862]
     that relies on a proactive registration to avoid the use of
      multicast. 6LoWPAN ND [RFC 6775, RFC 8505] inherits from IPv6 ND
      for mechanisms such as SLAAC and NUD, but uses a unicast method
      for DAD, and avoids multicast lookups from all nodes by using
      non-onlink prefixes. A 6LN is also expected to be an IPv6 host
      per [RFC 8200] which means it should ignore consumed routing
      headers and HbH options; when operating in a RPL [RFC 6550]
      network, it is also beneficial to support IP-in-IP encapsulation
      [draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo]. the 6LN should also support
      RFC 8505 and use it as the default ND method.
"


Voila, great doc by the way : )

Dear Pascal Thubert.

Thanks for your valuable comments.

These comments looks reasonable and are very helpful to improve the draft.

Please, find response inlines.

I will update the draft with your comments in a next revision.

Best regards

Yong-Geun.

[Yong-Geun]  Yes. Current draft does't include a reference of "IEEE Std
802.15.4' I will include the reference.

[Yong-Geun] It is an interesting draft and I acknowledged it. Although it
is a relevant draft with 6lo use cases, we are trying to narrow down the
scope of this draft and we would consider how to handle the draft.

[Yong-Geun] Yes, it miss the PLC draft and current PLC draft is a WG draft.
I will reflect.

[Yong-Geun] In a previous draft, Wi-Sun and jupitermesh were included. With
the purpose of narrowing down the scope of this draft. we removed a section
on Wi-Sun and jupitermesh, becuase these are mainly based on IEEE 802.15.4.
We would consider how to handle Wi-Sun.

The IESG has approved the following document:
- 'Packet Delivery Deadline time in 6LoWPAN Routing Header'
  (draft-ietf-6lo-deadline-time-05.txt) as Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the IPv6 over Networks of
Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group.

The IESG contact persons are Éric Vyncke and Suresh Krishnan.

A URL of this Internet Draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-deadline-time/





Technical Summary

  RFC 8138 specifies the 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH),
  compression schemes for RPL routing (source routing) 
   operation [RFC6554], header compression of RPL Packet
   Information [RFC6553], and IP-in-IP encapsulation.  This document
   specifies a new Deadline-6LoRHE type for the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Page 1,
   so that the deadline time of data packets can be included within the
   6LoWPAN routing header.  This document also specifies handling of the
   deadline time when packets traverse through time-synchronized
   networks operating in different timezones or distinct reference clocks.
   Time synchronization is not mandated in this document, rather it points to
    different available time synchronization solutions for low power and lossy networks.


Working Group Summary

Working group has provided many input towards development of the document during the initial phase before it is becoming a WG document.
Once these comments were incorporated into the document, the draft went for successful adoption call. After that  two reviewers provided thorough comments including the shepherd.
Working group has a rough consensus to move this draft towards IESG submission.


Document Quality

draft-ietf-6lo-deadline-time-01 has been implemented in open source OpenWSN environment and got merged
with the main distribution.

Dear 6Lo WG,

I recently submitted a draft for IPv6 over Controller Area Network and 
would like to call for adoption by the 6Lo WG.
The title of the document is draft-wachter-6lo-can-00 [1].

Controller Area Network (CAN) is a widely used field bus initially 
designed for the automotive domain. It has a payload length of eight 
bytes for classic CAN and 64 bytes for CAN-FD. CAN only describes the 
data-link-layer, but various protocols already exist on top. The 
submitted draft introduces IPv6 over CAN (6LoCAN),  a 6lo-adaption-layer 
to send IPv6 packets over the constrained CAN-bus. 6LoCAN uses a subset 
of the already widely used ISO-TP standard for fragmentation and 
reassembly to meet the 1280 minimum MTU requirement of IPv6. It also 
uses the IPHC (RFC6282) to reduce the protocol overhead of IPv6.

A broad range of devices, from small and cheap MCUs to big application 
processors, already have CAN controllers onboard. With 6LoCAN, it is 
possible to create networks of resource-constrained MCUs that can 
leverage the broad range of protocols and security mechanisms built on 
top of the IP.
Additionally, multiple 6LoCAN networks can be connected together or even 
to the internet by utilizing the routing capabilities of IP networks.

A reference implementation of 6LoCAN already exists in the mainline 
Zephyrproject RTOS [2] tree. It includes a sample server-client 
application. The source for it is located under [3] and can be used on 
any boards supporting CAN.

I am looking forward to your comments on the draft.

Kind regards,
Alexander

Dear Alexander,

Thanks for your new Internet Draft submission!

As a chair, I would like to clarify one procedural detail. When working
group (WG) chairs want to verify whether there exists WG consensus for
adopting a document as a WG document, the chairs issue a (somewhat) formal
"Call for adoption" email. It must be noted that your email below does not
correspond to a "Call for adoption" in the usual terms, and at this stage
you rather *mean* "Call for feedback".

Other than that, and with or without a particular hat, I think that what
you wrote below (and in the draft) is already useful to start assessing
whether 6Lo is the appropriate WG for your document. By the way, the CAN
MTU characteristics do correspond to significant constrainedness!

It is very positive that there exists already a reference implementation
available.

I have a few clarifying questions:

- What type of power sources can we expect for CAN devices?

- What bit rate/rates is/are typical in CAN?

- What kind of errors (e.g. due to BER) can we expect? Would CAN be
categorized as a lossy technology, or rather as a very low error rate
technology (e.g. Ethernet-like)?

Thanks,

Carles

They are usually mains-powered. In the automotive domain, it could be 
that nodes are battery-powered, but the battery is not a constraining 
factor.

The bit rate depends on the used cables, cable length, environment, ...
125 kbaud should work for long lines, 1 Mbaud for classic CAN and short 
lines, and up to 8 Mbaud for CAN-FD.

Bit errors may occur, but that heavily depends on the wiring and 
environment. Usually, we can expect a low BER [1]. Errors during 
transmission are detected, and the frame is retransmitted automatically. 
All nodes have an error counter and disconnect from the bus when the 
counter exceeds the limit. The bus is hard-wired, and nodes do not 
disappear.

Kind regards,
Alexander

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda based on the DRAFT AGENDA
for IETF106.  Remember that there is still quite some potential for
changes.

Conflicts that meet the eye:
LAKE/SUIT (already noted by Russ), BOF on top (thing security): TMRID.
ACE/RATS are also both security technologies that impact IoT.
COSE is a technology that might be relevant for WPACK.

All times are SGT (Singapore Time) =3D=3D UTC + 8 hours (=3D=3D China =
time).
Singapore doesn't obey the daylight savings myth.
(Pure UTC times at https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc are
useful for those who want to listen from remote.)

Dear Alexander,

Thanks for your responses.

To some extent, I see similarities between the environment you are
considering (CAN) and MS/TP. Few years ago, the 6Lo WG produced RFC 8163,
which specifies IPv6 over MS/TP.

I understand that using header compression reduces the amount of IPv6
packets that will require fragmentation. Also, it provides a more
efficient use of the bus. Interesting!

Cheers,

Carles

Hello Pascal,

While preparing my shepherd write-up for the 6lo fragment recovery draft, 
 I noticed one minor detail that I would like to bring to your attention.

In -05, draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly was added as a
reference. I think it is a bit odd that this document is mentioned for the
first time only at the end of the Security considerations section (note
that this reference is in fact a normative reference).

My proposal is updating the second paragraph of Section 1, and the last
paragraph of Section 2.4, so that
draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly is also introduced there.

For example, for Section 2.4, it could be something along the lines of:

CURRENT:
   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the
   datagram_tag as a label in a fashion similar to MPLS.  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

NEW:
   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the
   datagram_tag as a label in a fashion similar to MPLS. The technique is
   described in [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly].  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

... and something similar might work also for Section 1.

What do you think?

Thanks,

Carles (as the document shepherd)

The main difference I see between CAN and MS/TP is the packet/frame 
size. MS/TP satisfies the minimal requirements of 1500 octets minimal 
MTU where CAN only has 8 octets of payload per frame. 6LoCAN therefore 
defines a fragmentation an reassembly.

IPHC helps to reduce the number of frames needed to send an IPv6 packet. 
Nevertheless, sending an IPv6 packet in a single frame is only possible 
for CAN-FD (up to 64 bytes payload). Classical CAN always needs 
fragmentation and reassembly.

In my opinion, 6LoCAN is the right WG because it defines a 
"6lo-adaption-layer". It specifies a fragmentation and reassembly as 
other 6lo technologies do.

Kind regards,

Alexander

Your draft proposes using a subset of ISO-TP for fragmentation and
reassembly.

Clarifying question: is ISO-TP part of the CAN protocol (stack)?

I see. Anyway, there is the need to comply with the 1280-byte IPv6 MTU
requirement, but it is already satisfied in your draft.

I actually mentioned MS/TP and the (6Lo-produced) RFC 8163 to emphasize
the potential similarities with CAN (and 6LoCAN), since the 6Lo WG has
also dealt with technologies with somewhat different characteristics (e.g.
wireless, mesh topologies, energy-constrained devices, etc.).

The CAN specification does only define the data-link-layer. ISO-TP is an 
ISO-Standard (ISO 15765-2:2016). It defines a transport protocol and 
network layer services. 6LoCAN uses the fragmentation/reassembly and 
flow-control mechanism defined in this standard. Flow-control is only 
applied on unicast packets.

I see your point Carles.

You'll note that the abstract reference is minimal and that the LWIG draft =
is an implementation technique. There might be others. The ref that you ind=
icate shows that we ARE NOT doing what the LWIG draft says.=20

STD track RFC do not generally dictate implementation and do not discuss in=
ternals beyond an abstract view. We're on the way to get a number of DISCUS=
S'es during IESG review. Same as the ref to the minimal fragment I think we=
 could really use Suresh's advice.

If it's just me I'd rather not make the proposed change but rather move the=
 lwig draft to the informational references and make the following change:


Current=20
  =20
   The technique of Virtual Recovery Buffers inherited from
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment] may be used to perform a Denial-of-
   Service (DoS) attack against the intermediate Routers since the
   routers need to maintain a state per flow.  Note that as opposed to
   the VRB described in [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly] the
   data that is transported in each fragment is conserved and the state
   to keep does not include any data that would not fit in the previous
   fragment.

Subject: Fragment recovery, shepherd writeup: one minor point

Hello Pascal,

While preparing my shepherd write-up for the 6lo fragment recovery draft,  =
I noticed one minor detail that I would like to bring to your attention.

In -05, draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly was added as a reference=
. I think it is a bit odd that this document is mentioned for the first tim=
e only at the end of the Security considerations section (note that this re=
ference is in fact a normative reference).

My proposal is updating the second paragraph of Section 1, and the last par=
agraph of Section 2.4, so that draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly i=
s also introduced there.

For example, for Section 2.4, it could be something along the lines of:

CURRENT:
   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the
   datagram_tag as a label in a fashion similar to MPLS.  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

NEW:
   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the

   described in [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly].  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

... and something similar might work also for Section 1.

What do you think?

Thanks,

Carles (as the document shepherd)

Please note that the main reason of the text about it is to indicate that i=

For that reason it was actually strange to make it a normative reference, m=
any thanks for spotting it..

All the best;

Subject: Fragment recovery, shepherd writeup: one minor point

Hello Pascal,

While preparing my shepherd write-up for the 6lo fragment recovery draft,  =
I noticed one minor detail that I would like to bring to your attention.

In -05, draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly was added as a reference=
. I think it is a bit odd that this document is mentioned for the first tim=
e only at the end of the Security considerations section (note that this re=
ference is in fact a normative reference).

My proposal is updating the second paragraph of Section 1, and the last par=
agraph of Section 2.4, so that draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly i=
s also introduced there.

For example, for Section 2.4, it could be something along the lines of:

CURRENT:
   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the
   datagram_tag as a label in a fashion similar to MPLS.  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

NEW:
   "LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding" [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment]
   introduces the concept of a Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) and an
   associated technique to forward fragments as they come, using the
   datagram_tag as a label in a fashion similar to MPLS. The technique is
   described in [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly].  This
   specification reuses that technique with slightly modified controls.

... and something similar might work also for Section 1.

What do you think?

Thanks,

Carles (as the document shepherd)

Hi,

Might be appropriate to run this through the IPWAVE WG, too.

One question that comes to mind is how to make sure that the QoS of an 
IP packet on 802.11-OCB (wireless outside the car) is mapped to the 
right QoS of an IP packet on CAN inside the car.  This would help to 
send an IP packet from a Remote Controller straight into the brake of 
the car, with the appropriate priority and given the necessary credentials.

I want to ask you whether the CAN has a notion of CAN address and if 
yes, on how many bits is it represented (16?)?  This might help in 
thinking about how to form an Interface ID to be used with SLAAC on CAN. 
  One may think that should be 64bit, but I think not necessarily.

I want to ask you whether you think that the end to end principle is a 
good thing for the Internet, and if yes, whether Ethernet Border 
Translators might have an impact on that principle.

Yours,

Alex

> of the already widely used ISO-TP standard for fragmentation and 
> reassembly to meet the 1280 minimum MTU requirement of IPv6. It also 
> uses the IPHC (RFC6282) to reduce the protocol overhead of IPv6.
> 
> A broad range of devices, from small and cheap MCUs to big application

> possible to create networks of resource-constrained MCUs that can 
> leverage the broad range of protocols and security mechanisms built on 
> top of the IP.
> Additionally, multiple 6LoCAN networks can be connected together or even 
> to the internet by utilizing the routing capabilities of IP networks.
> 
> A reference implementation of 6LoCAN already exists in the mainline 
> Zephyrproject RTOS [2] tree. It includes a sample server-client 
> application. The source for it is located under [3] and can be used on 
> any boards supporting CAN.

Dear Alex,

Although CAN is mostly known for its use in the automotive domain, I 
didn't target automotive applications. I got the idea for 6LoCAN while I 
was thinking about using CAN for building automation. Nevertheless, 
posting a message about the draft to the IPWAVE group is a good idea.
Thanks for pointing me towards this WG.

Generally, CAN frames are prioritized by their frame identifier.
Lower number identifiers have precedence over higher numbers.
The identifier is composed by the destination "node address" and the 
sender "node address" and does not contain any QoS measurements.
There is a time-slicing protocol called TTCAN (Time-Triggered CAN), 
where hard real-time can be assured. 6LoCAN does not consider TTCAN and 
therefore has no guarantees for a reliable QoS.

Usually, CAN uses identifiers, identifying the content of the frame 
instead of address identifying nodes. These identifiers can either have 
a length of 11 bits or 29 bits. 6LoCAN uses 29 bits identifiers only.
Section 2 (Addressing) defines the way to form identifiers from the 
destination- and source-node-address. The node address has a length of 
14 bits. M is the multicast-bit and indicates to threat the first 14-bit 
field as a multicast-group instead of a destination address.

     0|0            1|1            2|
     0|1            4|5            8|
    +-+--------------+--------------+
    |M|     DEST     |     SRC      |
    +-+--------------+--------------+
Figure 1: Addressing Scheme

Section 4 (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) specifies how the 
interface ID is formed from the 14-bit node-address. See RFC4291 for 
more details.
The reason why 6LoCAN uses a 14-bit node-address is that a 
frame-identifier must always be unique on the bus. A unique identifier 
can be guaranteed by combining the unique source- and 
destination-node-address.
A violation of this rule would cause collisions outside the arbitration 
field that can't be resolved.

Despite this limited address-space of 14 bits, a random address 
assignment is possible due to a Link-Layer Duplicate Address Detection 
(LLDAD), defined in section 3.

The Ethernet Border Translator is optional for a 6LoCAN network.
I designed the Border Translator out of the lack of router capabilities 
of the Zephyr RTOS. This principle allows pushing complexity towards 
already existing network equipment and infrastructure.

Sincerely,

Alexander

If this goes somewhere in section 6, yes I think that makes it far more

By packets you mean fragments or reassembled datagrams. I don't really
understand what you mean by that.

Hello Martine
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I meant fragments. It can be expected that a few fragments are still i=

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes WG of the IETF.

        Title           : 6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery
        Author          : Pascal Thubert
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-07.txt
	Pages           : 26
	Date            : 2019-10-23

Abstract:
   This draft updates RFC 4944 with a simple protocol to recover
   individual fragments across a route-over mesh network, with a minimal
   flow control to protect the network against bloat.


The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery/

There are also htmlized versions available at:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-07
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-07

A diff from the previous version is available at:
https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery-07


Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Hi Pascal,

Sorry, I noticed this in your original mail, but forgot to mention it, now
it is also in the draft:

> [=E2=80=A6] Acknowledgment on the reverse path with a FULL bitmap, and ha=
rms a
> short timer to absorb packets that are still in flight for that [=E2=80=
=A6]

Do you mean "arms a short timer"?

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda based on the FINAL AGENDA
for IETF106.  Remember that, occasionally, futher agenda changes do
happen.

Quite a bit has been moved around from the draft agenda.
LAKE no longer conflicts with SUIT, TMRID is now on top of ROLL and
TEEP which is maybe a bit less of a problem for most.
ACE/RATS still conflict (and the other RATS meeting has moved from
Monday to Friday on top of COINRG, but you can do this RATS thing
without me, can you?).
WPACK no longer conflicts with COSE (but now does with LAKE, which
again probably just is a personal problem), LAKE/ANIMA is a technology
and a potential user again.

All times are SGT (Singapore Time) =3D=3D UTC + 8 hours (=3D=3D China =
time).
Singapore doesn't obey the daylight savings myth.
(Pure UTC times at https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc are
useful for those who want to listen from remote.)

Gr=C3=BC=C3=9Fe, Carsten
