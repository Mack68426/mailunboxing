Hi WG,

I got an offline comment about problem in draft-ietf-6lo-btle-04 Section 3.=
2.1.

The problem is that random device addresses (Section 2.3) have *all* 48 bit=
s random, and in Bluetooth LE packets there's a separate "49th" bit that in=
dicates whether the included device address is random or public (public bei=
ng formatted as defined in IEEE 802). To be more exact, TxAdd/RxAdd bits in=
 an advertising channel PDU indicate whether device address, which is in PD=
U's payload, is public (value 0) or random (value 1) - for more details see=
 Bluetooth Core_v4.1.pdf starting page 2504 "2.3 Advertising channel PDU").

That causes a problem if Modified EUI-64 is generated from these random 48b=
its as defined in RFC2464/RFC4291, because the values of universal/local an=
d individual/group bits would be random.=20

My idea to solve this is to follow RFC4291 Appendix A's guidance for "Links=
 with Other Kinds of Identifiers" and define that for Bluetooth LE IID, the=
 Bluetooth Device address is placed into bottom 48-bits of an IID, and the =
top 16 bits would be hard-coded to 0 except for u and maybe for g bits. So =
Bluetooth LE IID would be:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |000000ug00000000|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Where u would reflect the whether the 48 bottom bits are universal or local=
 (reflecting the status from Bluetooth device address as indicated in Bluet=
ooth), and the g would be zero (as no multicast in Bluetooth).

Would this kind of change to IID generation make sense? Opinions, better id=
eas?

	Teemu

Hi Teemu,

I think that it makes sense and it should solve the issue.

I am not fully agree about the g bit, I would keep it open to set it as 1
or zero in the future. I assume that with the new Bluetooth specification
4.2, more multicast applications will emerge, since the network is much
more closer to a mesh sensor network. In fact, Bluetooth offers a very
powerful connection-less communication mode based on the advertisements /
beacons. Therefore, it can be used technically used to support a multicast
packet on top of it, where the devices can filter considering the addresses
from the 6LoWPAN header embedded.

BR,
Antonio J. Jara

Teemu,

RFC7136 means you don't have to adhere to the U/G bits anymore.

Ole,

Ah I didn't remember that RFC. So we could defined that IID for IPv6 BLE is=
 following, right?

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|bbbbbbbb11111111|11111110bbbbbbbb|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Where b stands for bits from Bluetooth Device Address? This format might be=
 easiest for implementations to utilize (and would make particular sense wh=
en device address is actually 48 bit unique address). Perhaps.

Thanks,

	Teemu

yes, you could do that.
of course there is also work strongly recommending against putting L2 =
addresses in IPv6 addresses. that may or may not apply here. at least =
the IPv6 over foo should offer a mechanism for privacy.
I presume any of the other interface-id schemes could be used for IPv6 =

Hello Ole:

Putting a MAC into a V6 address is the way 6LoWPAN performs stateless addre=
ss compression. It is critical to us in the current shape of things.
Making sure that the flow label is zeroed out when the LLN does not use is =
another thing we do for compression purposes.
And 6LoWPAN ND is also an adaptation for the low power environment. All thi=
s appear as a schism that is only getting wider.

We are in a situation where efforts are effectively needed to avoid diverge=
nce that would lead to 2 different and incompatible versions of IPv6.

Cheers,

Pascal

Hi,

We are mandating use of MAC derived IID for link-local addresses - and only=
 for link-local addresses. This allows both 6LN and 6LBR to know what link-=
local address 6LN uses for the connection, and hence avoids need to consume=
 energy for NS (with ARO) for IID used for link-local address (section 3.2.=
1 of the draft).

For non-link-local scoped addresses we support use of random IIDs (with ref=
erence to ietf-6man-default-iids), but those IIDs then need to be registere=
d with NS containing ARO.

Bets regards,

	Teemu

Do I have it right that:

1) draft-thubert-roll-flow-label-02 compresses RPL RPI but not RH3
2) draft-thubert-6lo-rpl-nhc-02 compresses RPL RPI and might be extended =
to compress RH3
3) draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch-01 compresses both RPL RPI and RH3

In discussion during the IETF-91 6lo working group meeting, a concern =
was raised about further consumption of NHC codepoints beyond what is =

Hello Ralph=20

You certainly got it all right.

To your question we started through the NHC and found that path less effici=
ent than Laurent's initial suggestion to place all the LLN routing artifact=
s in a different header/dispatch whatever the correct term is for that obje=
ct.

One additional concern that doesn't show in your mail is the need for IP en=
capsulation when the artifacts are added by a router on the way or must be =
removed at LLN egress. By leaving the original IPv6 packet intact we simpli=
fy that matter and optimize the overall result by providing an improved com=
pression for the outter header.

The new proposal also reopens the dispatch space (1/3 of the total) that is=
 used is mesh under for mesh header, so it can also be use AND extended as =
TLV in route over.

Makes sense?

Pascal

Yeah, I noticed the issue of IP encap hasn't been addressed (if I recall =
correctly) in draft-thubert-6lo-rpl-nhc...

But ... in my opinion, moving the LLN artifacts to the header/dispatch =
in the way defined in draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch raises, =
implicitly, an important architectural issue: is the information in the =
dispatch header compressed IPv6 headers or headers for an independent, =
sub-IP protocol?

My understanding is that the IETF has made an architectural decision to =
do all the mesh network forwarding and routing in IPv6, so as to reuse =
as much as possible existing technology and associated infrastructure =
such as OAM.  If the dispatch header does not contain compressed IPv6 =
headers, per se, then this architectural question would lead me to =
investigate the completeness of the new protocol and the impacts of the =
new protocol on IPv6 and network operations. =20

There are both architectural and pragmatic issues in the design of the =
RPL-in-dispatch protocol.

The upcoming bakeoff might be a way to stimulate some running code that =
would check out all the potential impacts of moving the RPL information =
to a sub-IP protocol.

Yes, and, in this particular case, there are at least 4 working groups =

Hello Ralph:

[PT] Yes, by design. The NHC draft has a more pragmatic and limited scope.=
=20
It covers the compression of the RPL option.=20
Whatever is used for IP in IP compression and RH3 is unchanged by that draf=
t.

> But ... in my opinion, moving the LLN artifacts to the header/dispatch in=

[PT] That would not be the goal, Ralph.=20

The idea is that there is a biunivocal correspondence between the compresse=
d and the uncompressed format.
The outter header with the RPL option and the RH3 (whichever are needed) wo=
uld be placed in the new dispatch.=20
But the 6LoWPAN expansion would result in the packet as it stands today.

Makes sense?

My answer is that a sub-IP protocol can encapsulate arbitrary layer-3 packets.
In particular, one can have overlapping IP addressing contexts, and there is
no implicit l3-routing assumed between sub-IP protocols.
In the LLN case, the l3-layer is constrained; the additional "tag" (the RPL
Instance ID) is used to select a particular QoS much like the DSCP can do.
Routing between instanceIDs is assumed; but potentially not every node has
the specific routes that permits it to do that.

I think that all of the HC methods *can* be implemented as Bump-in-the-Stack
activities; and in particular the loop LLN->ethernet->LLN should be
lossless(%). (ethernet->LLN->ethernet is both out of scope [the LLN is never
a transit network], and also potentially lossy as some generality of 6553 and
6554 may sacrificed.

(%)-lossless definition assumes flow label is always zero.

A think that concerns me is that I think that most constrained devices will
not implement HC as a bump in the stack, but will uncompress the headers
directly into internal control structures, and may have loose the ability to
process uncompressed 6553/6554 headers.

One could view this as a vestigal appendix-like thing that evolved away.
This could be regarded as good: less unused/untested code that will get
exploited.   This could be regarded as bad: as frame sizes in LLN radios grow
(802.15.4g, I'm told, has much larger frames) some systems might have no
6lowpan layer, and interoperation opportunities might become difficult.

(I picked the appendix on purpose: some say that it was used to digest
grasses/cellulose. If we had a useful appendix, humans might never starve...)

An experiment which I have yet to do is to see what happens if one applies
GHC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7400) to 6553 and 6554.

Not sure how that relates to a sub-IP protocol for carrying source =

That statement gets to part of my question about =
draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch: in the abstract, is =
draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch intended to provide a mechanism =
through which the original RPI, RH3 and IP-in-IP headers can be =
reconstructed before sending the resulting IPv6 datagram up to the IPv6 =
stack?  At the risk of being overly concerned with the details, I really =
mean "reconstruct the header" as opposed to "carry information that can =

Yeah.  We already see a side-effect of this form of implementation in =
the desire for compression techniques that do not result in expansion =
during transit, because such expansion can require re-fragmentation of a =
datagram that might otherwise be forwarded in place without explicitly =
uncompressing to the full IPv6 representation.

I think there are also important issues to think about the interaction =
between a sub-IP protocol and the rest of the IPv6 protocol.  If the =
abstraction is that the sub-IP bits reconstruct into IPv6 headers, we =
may have less collateral damage to worry about.  Documents defining that =

It's a meaningless and ambiguous term, particularly in IPv6.  Perhaps there
is a better one in some BEHAVE document.
What I mean is that you can run ten different 10.0.0.0/8 RFC1918 networks
simultaneously on the same link using one of the sub-IP protocols...

Correct, any node could be part of multiple DODAGs which have been optimized
differently.  Whether those nodes will route traffic along a shorter path
than going to (respective) DODAG roots, and then out again is really outside
of our scope, let's just agree that it is a reasonable.
(Consider a powered light bulb router that participates in both the light
control DODAG, and also the TV remote control DODAG)

I guess it depends upon what you mean by "sub-IP".
I think that we are speaking about it in the former IETF AREA sense; things
which are below IP, which have a layering distinction from IP, and which
can simultaenously carry a multitude of layer-3 protocols.  MPLS for
instance.

Are you considering 6lowpan HC to be a sub-IP protocol?
Is PPP a sub-IP protocol?
Is PPP VJ compression a sub-IP protocol?

I think that this is the intent, and I see this as a good thing.

Yes, exactly: ethernet bridge of LLN between metal floors or other radio
opaque barriers.

I agree completely.
One of the concerns I realized with rpl-flow-label was that it created an
alternative to 6553 which was not equivalent.  It's better actually, even on
Ethernet-like media.  It's also easier to implement in ASICs and current
protocol stacks because filters which match the flow label area available
already.  As such, if we go the rpl-flow-label way, we should probably
obsolete 6553 since we have present way to negotiate or announce what
should be used for a given network.

Hi:

6LoWPAN HC and the new draft proposals (NHC, dispatch, all apart from the f=
low label) are encoding procedures that can be reversed so as to restore th=
e original packet.
The term sub IP, should it refer to an encapsulation like a vlan, would be =
inappropriate. If it refers to an adaptation layer below IP, it would apply=
.=20
But if the meaning is unclear, then we need to clarify before using it.=20

Cheers,

Pascal

Thank you Tom for point at RFC2663 for "address domain".=20

So, again, I think a key reason why the various HC are not a sub-IP protocol
is because rfc6553 does not create new addressing domains with the RPL
InstanceID.

Can we agree that this is not a sub-IP signalization problem.

Yes, Michael.

I think it would help to take that out of the equation.

Little point -- there is very little inherent redundancy on the byte 
sequence level.

Hi,

Due to another piece of offline feedback, we're planning on clarifying Sect=
ion 3.2.2. bullet 1 al little bit, into:

1.  A Bluetooth LE 6LN SHOULD NOT register its IID for

    link-local address. A Bluetooth LE 6LN MUST register its IIDs for non-l=
ink-local addresses

    with the 6LBR by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with

    the Address Registration Option (ARO) and process the Neighbor

    Advertisement (NA) accordingly.  The NS with the ARO option MUST be

    sent irrespective of the method used to generate the IID.  If the 6LN

    registers multiple IIDs per IPv6 prefix available on a link, the 6LBR

    will not be able to fully elide IID on downlink packets (6LBR has

    to send IID bits inline).


Hence I will soon update the draft with this and with the IID generation ch=
anges, if no further comments arise.

Teemu

Everyone=E2=80=94

I have some comments to make about this draft as a participating individual=
.

I'm not convinced that repurposing the RFC 4944 Mesh Header is necessary,
and the draft offers no explanation for choosing that direction. It seems
to me that using LOWPAN_NHC for compressing both the RPI option and the RH3
option, and LOWPAN_IPHC for compressing IP-in-IP headers, would have been
the intuitively obvious approach to take, and I don't understand why
stepping on the Mesh Header instead was the approach taken here.

Yes, usage of the MESH codes is not well specified in any standards track
documents, but I contend that deprecating their definition in RFC 4944
should not be done in the same action as defining their new standard
purpose. That's a procedural argument, but I have technical concerns too.

My first observation is that this draft lifts some hop-by-hop and routing
header extensions out of the IPv6 datagram in which they are encapsulated.
So, that means if I'm looking at a RFC 6282 packet today, and I want to
find the IPv6 header, thenI can look at the dispatch type and if it's IPv6,
then I've got the uncompressed packet right there, and if it's LOWPAN_IPHC,
then I've got the start of the compressed version. Full stop. With this
draft, though, I don't actually find the LOWPAN_IPHC until I've first
traversed the preceding chain of 6LoRH headers, all of which I have to
remember because they will be necessary in the decompression of the
encapsulated IPv6 packet. That's complicated and eats CPU resources.

My second observation is that it's a simple process today to define a
general IPv6 extension, then to define a 6LoWPAN compression scheme in
another separable step. New extension headers go inside LOWPAN_NHC and all
you need to do is define how to compress them when NH=3D1. This draft
complicates all that by adding a new scheme to the existing mix, where all
manner of extension headers might be compressed in 6LoRH headers with new
type codes to be defined in the future. Each new extension header needs a
new 6LoRH header type defined for it in addition to the new compression
scheme, and the 6LoRH header type is a small number space, so it will be
subject to additional conservative pressure.  This means defining a new
IPv6 extension really isn't complete until you've said something about how
6LoRH headers are used with it. To be honest, I think that 6MAN should be
consulted for their considerations about that.

Lastly, I observe that offline analysis of 6LoWPAN packets will be
complicated by the fact that it's not possible to identify from the bits in
the packet whether it was encoded according to RFC 4944 and the MESH header
was used, or if it was encoded according to this draft and the 6LoRH header
was used. What is Wireshark supposed to do when it dissects a 6LoWPAN
encoded octet stream and it sees what is currently marked as a MESH header
dispatch? Assume it knows better than the encoder what it used? Ask the
Wireshark user to decide with a modal pop-up? Please. Whatever it does will
bring unnecessary headaches.

Shorter james: I think this draft is an overly complicated solution to the
problem it proposes to solve, and I see little benefit in trading that
complication for whatever it is I'm supposed to get in trade for it. Which
is what, again?

I get that it would be nice if IETF had defined those MESH codes in the
dispatch header better, but I think it makes more sense to reclaim those
codes in a two-phase procedure: phase one, deprecate the Mesh Header; then
phase two, assign new semantics only when existing reserved code space has
been fully consumed. That action should be separated from the action to
solve the problems that RPL is facing today.

Everyone=E2=80=94

After discussing my concerns with a colleague (who was busy while I was
drafting my previous message on this topic), I now realize that I
misinterpreted the text of RFC 6282 in a way that explains why what seemed
to me like the intuitively obvious approach isn't workable.

It comes down to the fact that LOWPAN_NHC doesn't actually allow you to
define compression formats for any of the IPv6 Extension Headers. RFC 6282
*does* define a compression format for some UDP headers, but a strict
interpretation of the text doesn't leave any room for compressing the RPI
or RH3 options when preceded by a LOWPAN_NHC octet even when NH=3D1. (Why
not? I can imagine some reasons.)

But that's not a big problem. The slightly less intuitively obvious
approach would now seem to be to define a new LOWPAN_NHC EID code
(proposed: 5) as a Compressed IPv6 Extension Header, which would entail
that the following octet encode an identification of the compression method
with the Next Header field and the uncompressed Length field, and the
octets following that encode the rest of the compressed IPv6 Extension
Header (citing RFC 6564 informationally to drive home the point that this
eliminates the possibility of expansion).

It would then be reasonable to use the 6LO_RPI and 6LO_RH3 compressions in
the draft under construction after the LOWPAN_NHC octet instead of the
dispatch bit.  What's wrong with this?

, then I&#39;ve got the uncompressed packet right there, and if it&#39;s LO=
WPAN_IPHC, then I&#39;ve got the start of the compressed version. Full stop=
. With this draft, though, I don&#39;t actually find the LOWPAN_IPHC until =
I&#39;ve first traversed the preceding chain of 6LoRH headers, all of which=
 I have to remember because they will be necessary in the decompression of =
the encapsulated IPv6 packet. That&#39;s complicated and eats CPU resources=
.<br></div><div><br></div><div>My second observation is that it&#39;s a sim=
ple process today to define a general IPv6 extension, then to define a 6LoW=
PAN compression scheme in another separable step. New extension headers go =
inside LOWPAN_NHC and all you need to do is define how to compress them whe=
n NH=3D1. This draft complicates all that by adding a new scheme to the exi=
sting mix, where all manner of extension headers might be compressed in 6Lo=
RH headers with new type codes to be defined in the future. Each new extens=
ion header needs a new 6LoRH header type defined for it in addition to the =
new compression scheme, and the 6LoRH header type is a small number space, =
so it will be subject to additional conservative pressure.=C2=A0 This means=
 defining a new IPv6 extension really isn&#39;t complete until you&#39;ve s=
aid something about how 6LoRH headers are used with it. To be honest, I thi=
nk that 6MAN should be consulted for their considerations about that.</div>=
<div><br></div><div>Lastly, I observe that offline analysis of 6LoWPAN pack=
ets will be complicated by the fact that it&#39;s not possible to identify =
from the bits in the packet whether it was encoded according to RFC 4944 an=
d the MESH header was used, or if it was encoded according to this draft an=
d the 6LoRH header was used. What is Wireshark supposed to do when it disse=
cts a 6LoWPAN encoded octet stream and it sees what is currently marked as =
a MESH header dispatch? Assume it knows better than the encoder what it use=
d? Ask the Wireshark user to decide with a modal pop-up? Please. Whatever i=
t does will bring unnecessary headaches.</div><div><br></div><div>Shorter j=
ames: I think this draft is an overly complicated solution to the problem i=
t proposes to solve, and I see little benefit in trading that complication =
for whatever it is I&#39;m supposed to get in trade for it. Which is what, =
again?</div><div><br></div><div>I get that it would be nice if IETF had def=
ined those MESH codes in the dispatch header better, but I think it makes m=
ore sense to reclaim those codes in a two-phase procedure: phase one, depre=
cate the Mesh Header; then phase two, assign new semantics only when existi=
ng reserved code space has been fully consumed. That action should be separ=
ated from the action to solve the problems that RPL is facing today.</div><=

That provision is necessary because there is no way in an *uncompressed* 
header to indicate the presence of further compressed headers.

(But maybe I don't understand the question.)

I'm not sure why you say this.

    A compliant implementation of [RFC4944] as updated by this document
    MUST be able to properly process a packet received that makes use of
    the provisions of this document.  A compliant implementation MAY
    implement additional LOWPAN_NHC types (Section 4) that may be
    registered (Section 5) in the future.  It is out of scope of this
    document how a compressor learns that a decompressor has additional
    capabilities.

If we register the thing, it is there.

Indeed, what strict interpretation is that?

(Indeed, we cannot compress *options*, just entire headers.  But that is 
a mostly trivial limitation.)

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Carsten=E2=80=94

The relevant excerpt from RFC 6282 section 4.2 is near the bottom of page
15.

   NH: Next Header:

      0: Full 8 bits for Next Header are carried in-line.

      1: The Next Header field is elided and the next header is encoded
         using LOWPAN_NHC, which is discussed in Section 4.1
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6282#section-4.1>.

   For the most part, the IPv6 Extension Header is carried unmodified in
   the bytes immediately following the LOWPAN_NHC octet, with two
   important exceptions: Length field and Next Header field.


This "carried unmodified in the bytes immediately following phrase" pretty
clearly requires that IPv6 Extension Headers appear in either one of two
currently defined types: A) the entire uncompressed extension header
[including the Next Header field in the first octet, which is redundant
because it's implied by the EID code], and B) the entire uncompressed
extension header less the Next Header field in the first octet [which is
inferred from the EID code].  The "for the most part" qualifier is
dangling, but it's easy to see how it could be referring to the UDP type
which defines compression and not to the IPv6 Extension Header type, which
does not. (Though, see p4 below.)

Some observations spring to mind.

p1. Section 4.1, which is referenced in the NH=3D1 case, just says that the=
re
are two currently defined types of LOWPAN_NHC, i.e. a) IPv6 Extension
Header and b) UDP. It doesn't actually say how either of them are encoded.

p2. The NH bit is just used for signaling the end of the LOWPAN_NHC chain.
However, as a colleague snarked this morning to me, there isn't really any
need for a chain of LOWPAN_NHC headers=E2=80=94 they don't compress anythin=
g until
you get to the LOWPAN_NHC UDP header=E2=80=94 you could have just as easily=
 defined
the IPv6 Extension Header variant with a few bits to signal the count of
the number of extension headers to parse before finding the upper-layer
transport protocol header.

p3. There is nothing in RFC 6282 to help decide what to do when processing
LOWPAN_NHC IPv6 Extension Headers with NH=3D0 and the Next Header field in
the succeeding uncompressed header does not match what is implied by the
EID code. If it were my code, then I'd silently ignore the EID and use the
value from the uncompressed header, but it seems like the specification
could be more clear.

p4. The phrase "with two important exceptions: Length field and Next Header
field" is troubling to me. The following paragraph seems like it's trying
to contradict the previous statement that "the IPv6 Extension Header is
carried unmodified in the bytes immediately following" excerpt.

   The Length field contained in a compressed IPv6 Extension Header
   indicates the number of octets that pertain to the (compressed)
   extension header following the Length field.  Note that this changes
   the Length field definition in [RFC2460
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460>] from indicating the header
   size in 8-octet units, not including the first 8 octets.  Changing
   the Length field to be in units of octets removes wasteful internal
   fragmentation.


This seems to be the only language I can find in RFC 6282 that admits the
possibility of IPv6 Extension Headers appearing with their contents
modified by any compression method. Alas, there isn't language explaining
how any of the extension headers in RFC 2460 are to be compressed, so the
only reasonable assumption is a null compression method that allows for
alignment padding to be removed. However, what is to be done if the
Compressed Length (in octets) does not match any valid Uncompressed Length
(in 8-octet units)? Given the more clear language in the previous excerpt,
I would have to interpret that as an error and break off processing of the
packet, but I can't point to any text in the RFC to say that's what should
be done.

It's all very unclear. Nevertheless, my overarching point stands: there
ought to be a way to compress the RPI and RH3 headers and the IP-in-IP
header with only an update to RFC 6282 and not requiring an update to RFC
4494 to step on the MESH codes in the dispatch header.

Hi Teemu,

thanks for these updates.

Strictly speaking, the 6LN registers IPv6 addresses, not IIDs, with the 
6LBR; I like that aspect of the -04 wording better.  I'm still trying to 
wrap my head around the condition for being able to elide the IID part 
of an address -- as described in 3.2.3, it is that multiple addresses 
weren't registered for a prefix, but it is not quite clear to me how 6LN 
and 6LBR agree that this is indeed the case (ARO makes sure an address 
is registered, but how do we make sure no other address is still 
registered?).

Maybe it is also worth pointing out that the procedure described in 
section 3.2.2 (inverting U/L as per appendix A of RFC 4291) is also 
replaced by the procedures described here -- I'm not sure every 
implementer will infer that.

Gre, Carsten

James,

Jumping to your last point below, I agree that the most straight-forward ap=
proach to compressing RPL extension headers is with an update to RFC 6282. =
 I think you are being too strict in following what=92s written in RFC 6282=
.  I would expect an update to RFC 6282 to make the necessary changes.

Some clarifications below.

On Jan 9, 2015, at 3:58 PM, James Woodyatt <jhw@nestlabs.com<mailto:jhw@nes=
tlabs.com>> wrote:

The relevant excerpt from RFC 6282 section 4.2 is near the bottom of page 1=
5.


   NH: Next Header:

      0: Full 8 bits for Next Header are carried in-line.

      1: The Next Header field is elided and the next header is encoded
         using LOWPAN_NHC, which is discussed in Section 4.1<http://tools.i=
etf.org/html/rfc6282#section-4.1>.

   For the most part, the IPv6 Extension Header is carried unmodified in
   the bytes immediately following the LOWPAN_NHC octet, with two
   important exceptions: Length field and Next Header field.

This "carried unmodified in the bytes immediately following phrase" pretty =
clearly requires that IPv6 Extension Headers appear in either one of two cu=
rrently defined types: A) the entire uncompressed extension header [includi=
ng the Next Header field in the first octet, which is redundant because it'=
s implied by the EID code], and B) the entire uncompressed extension header=
 less the Next Header field in the first octet [which is inferred from the =
EID code].  The "for the most part" qualifier is dangling, but it's easy to=
 see how it could be referring to the UDP type which defines compression an=
d not to the IPv6 Extension Header type, which does not. (Though, see p4 be=
low.)

In (A), the EID and Next Header field are not redundant.  The EID serves as=
 the Next Header field of the *previous* compressed header.  If the NH bit =
in the previous header is set, then the Next Header field is elided.

In (B), Pad1 and PadN Options may be elided in certain situations.  Further=
more, the Length field specifies octets rather than multiples of 8 octets. =
 So the compressed form modifies the Next Header and Hdr Ext Len encoding. =
 If there are Pad1 and PadN options, the compressed form may also elide the=
 trailing bytes of an IPv6 Extension Header.

Some observations spring to mind.

p1. Section 4.1, which is referenced in the NH=3D1 case, just says that the=
re are two currently defined types of LOWPAN_NHC, i.e. a) IPv6 Extension He=
ader and b) UDP. It doesn't actually say how either of them are encoded.

Section 4.1 describes the use of a var-len NHC ID, which is the entry point=
 to LOWPAN_NHC and UDP.  Future var-len NHC IDs may be defined in an update=
s draft.

p2. The NH bit is just used for signaling the end of the LOWPAN_NHC chain. =
However, as a colleague snarked this morning to me, there isn't really any =
need for a chain of LOWPAN_NHC headers=97 they don't compress anything unti=
l you get to the LOWPAN_NHC UDP header=97 you could have just as easily def=
ined the IPv6 Extension Header variant with a few bits to signal the count =
of the number of extension headers to parse before finding the upper-layer =
transport protocol header.

I admit the existing definitions do not compress much in some cases, but th=
ey do allow the removal of Pad1 and PadN options and the 8 octet alignment =
requirement - which may result in up to 7 bytes savings per extension heade=
r.

p3. There is nothing in RFC 6282 to help decide what to do when processing =
LOWPAN_NHC IPv6 Extension Headers with NH=3D0 and the Next Header field in =
the succeeding uncompressed header does not match what is implied by the EI=
D code. If it were my code, then I'd silently ignore the EID and use the va=
lue from the uncompressed header, but it seems like the specification could=
 be more clear.

As mentioned above, there is no redundancy between the EID and Next Header =
field.

p4. The phrase "with two important exceptions: Length field and Next Header=
 field" is troubling to me. The following paragraph seems like it's trying =
to contradict the previous statement that "the IPv6 Extension Header is car=
ried unmodified in the bytes immediately following" excerpt.


   The Length field contained in a compressed IPv6 Extension Header
   indicates the number of octets that pertain to the (compressed)
   extension header following the Length field.  Note that this changes
   the Length field definition in [RFC2460<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc24=
60>] from indicating the header
   size in 8-octet units, not including the first 8 octets.  Changing
   the Length field to be in units of octets removes wasteful internal
   fragmentation.

This seems to be the only language I can find in RFC 6282 that admits the p=
ossibility of IPv6 Extension Headers appearing with their contents modified=
 by any compression method. Alas, there isn't language explaining how any o=
f the extension headers in RFC 2460 are to be compressed, so the only reaso=
nable assumption is a null compression method that allows for alignment pad=
ding to be removed. However, what is to be done if the Compressed Length (i=
n octets) does not match any valid Uncompressed Length (in 8-octet units)? =
Given the more clear language in the previous excerpt, I would have to inte=
rpret that as an error and break off processing of the packet, but I can't =
point to any text in the RFC to say that's what should be done.

RFC 6282 does not directly deal with contents being modified by alternative=
 compression methods.  It merely provides some entry points for future enco=
dings.  I would expect an Updates draft to handle the questions you pose ab=
ove.

It's all very unclear. Nevertheless, my overarching point stands: there oug=
ht to be a way to compress the RPI and RH3 headers and the IP-in-IP header =
with only an update to RFC 6282 and not requiring an update to RFC 4494 to =
step on the MESH codes in the dispatch header.

As mentioned above, I agree with you.

I'm not sure why you say this.

   A compliant implementation of [RFC4944] as updated by this document
   MUST be able to properly process a packet received that makes use of
   the provisions of this document.  A compliant implementation MAY
   implement additional LOWPAN_NHC types (Section 4) that may be
   registered (Section 5) in the future.  It is out of scope of this
   document how a compressor learns that a decompressor has additional
   capabilities.

If we register the thing, it is there.

RFC
6282 *does* define a compression format for some UDP headers, but a
strict interpretation of the text doesn't leave any room for compressing
the RPI or RH3 options when preceded by a LOWPAN_NHC octet even when
NH=3D1. (Why not? I can imagine some reasons.)

Indeed, what strict interpretation is that?

(Indeed, we cannot compress *options*, just entire headers.  But that is a =
mostly trivial limitation.)

Hi Carsten,

Right, I had forgotten the RFC6775 sentence:" the address that is to be reg=
istered MUST be the IPv6 source address of the NS message".=20

In the RFC6282 with SAC=3D1, DAM=3D11 the idea is to derive address from co=
ntext and link-layer address. This would work nicely if addresses were base=
d on Bluetooth Device Address. However, with random IIDs eliding the IID be=
comes more challenging. The idea here is that if a node has registered only=
 one IPv6 address for a prefix, and there's compression context for the pre=
fix, the address could be fully elided as both 6LN and 6LBR would know from=
 the context information that it is this one address that has been elided. =
When multiple addresses would be configured for the same prefix, then the I=
ID part would need to be transmitted inline (and prefix bits would come fro=
m context information).

I guess if 6LBR would have two address registrations for a 6LN and the 6LN =
for some reason would think it has only one, the 6LN might elide its addres=
s and then 6LBR would have problem decompressing.. But I'm not sure how thi=
s situation could arise, as device reboots/Bluetooth disconnections should =
clear related state on both entities, and registration timeouts clear extra=
 entries from 6LBR.

So attempting to elide random IID definitely increases complexity. If we'd =
decide that random IIDs shall be always carrier inline, we'd get simpler so=
lution.. but with more bits transmitted with each packet. Implementations w=
ould then made tradeoff between compression efficiency and privacy (if usin=
g static BDADDR). We could also force just one address registration per pre=
fix, which would support random IIDs and avoid synchronization problems due=
 6LBR refusing to register multiple addresses for the same prefix from the =
same host..=20

Next proposal for the text:
	 1.  A Bluetooth LE 6LN SHOULD NOT register its=20
	 link-local address. A Bluetooth LE 6LN MUST register its non-link-local a=
ddresses
   	 with the 6LBR by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with
    	 the Address Registration Option (ARO) and process the Neighbor
     	 Advertisement (NA) accordingly.  The NS with the ARO option MUST be
    	 sent irrespective of the method used to generate the IID.  If the 6LN
    	 registers multiple addresses per compression context, the 6LN=20
	 and 6LBR will have to send IID bits inline as in that case there is not e=
nough
 	information available for computing back an elided IID.

I thought we should not discuss about semantics of IID:) So would this text=
 be clearer:
--
of 0xFF and 0xFE in the middle of the 48-bit Bluetooth device address as sh=
own in Figure 4.  In the Figure letter 'b' represents a bit from Bluetooth =
device address, copied as is without any changes on any bit.

Best regards,

	Teemu

thanks for these updates.

Strictly speaking, the 6LN registers IPv6 addresses, not IIDs, with the 6LB=
R; I like that aspect of the -04 wording better.  I'm still trying to wrap =
my head around the condition for being able to elide the IID part of an add=
ress -- as described in 3.2.3, it is that multiple addresses weren't regist=
ered for a prefix, but it is not quite clear to me how 6LN and 6LBR agree t=
hat this is indeed the case (ARO makes sure an address is registered, but h=
ow do we make sure no other address is still registered?).

Maybe it is also worth pointing out that the procedure described in section=
 3.2.2 (inverting U/L as per appendix A of RFC 4291) is also replaced by th=
e procedures described here -- I'm not sure every implementer will infer th=
at.

Gr=FC=DFe, Carsten

Right. I temporarily lost my mind there. It happens. Thank you for the

So then why didn't I-D.thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch use them? Can we see a
draft that uses these entry points instead of eating the whole range of
MESH codes out of the dispatch header?

Because that's not the NHC draft (which does exactly that), but a quite 
different one.

Here, the idea is to use the adaptation layer to encode information that 
doesn't necessarily live in exactly that form in an IP option or 
extension.  So this isn't compression like NHC, it is something that can 
be operated on before the IP layer processing, like the old mesh header 
was intended to be.  (This is similar to how the flow label hack works 
in practice -- this one also is applied *below* the IP header that 
carries it.  The NHC approach needs an explicit IP-in-IP, which is only 
bearable because we can compress it so well; the actual processing in an 
implementation is more like the routing dispatch, though.)

BTW, I still haven't heard a cogent argument why we can't fix the mesh 
header.  (I'm not talking about the theoretical fact that we did assign 
these dispatch codes in 2007, I'm talking about any actual 
interoperability problem that might be the outcome of such a change.)

If I understand Pascal's explanation correctly, the mesh header would =

uncompressed header formats (completely reconstructing the original IPv6 =

My concern is that carrying information needed for the operation of RPL =

used for RPL starts us down the path of defining a sub-IP protocol.  =
Such an architecture needs careful cross-IETF review.

Yes.  The question is, do we need to carry around an outer IP-in-IP 
header for that or not.  routing-dispatch would imply that header (it is 
never reified, except when leaving the 6lo domain).

I'm fully with you on that point.  The counter-argument I heard so far 
was that we can't use the code points, which is a quite different 
argument, and one I can only follow in theory, not in practice.

Yes, we have to make the architectural implications of a dispatch-based 
architecture very, very clear.

E.g., when compressing RFC 6554, there is *no* need to preserve 
previously executed hops, because a non-storing node cannot make use of 
that information in any sensible way.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

My views on what I think are the salient points in the discussion so far:=


1) Use of interop to validate a way forward

I don't agree that a specification has to be set in stone for an=20
interop. The whole point of an interop sometimes is to test the=20
specification and expect it to change afterwards. If there are a number=20
of proposals, then it doesn't seem unreasonable to clearly specify each=20
proposal and implement all proposals. This in itself will give an idea=20
of complexity; the interop will give an idea of issues arising and=20
therefore it should help in deciding which one is the best as clearly=20
there doesn't seem to be consensus based solely on the drafts.

2) Choice of proposals

Assuming elimination isn't going to occur via the mailing list, the=20
three options are:

a. draft-thubert-roll-flow-label-02 (RPI only)
b. draft-thubert-6lo-rpl-nhc-02 but pick one of the three (greedy,=20
conservative, efficient) first (RPI only)
c. draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch-01 (RPI and RH3)

This implies the current method would be used for RH3 in cases (a) and (b=
).

3) Compression of RH3 using NHC

This could be developed as an alternative. I don't recall the NHC=20
approach being abandoned.

4) Time schedule

Carsten gave a good summary earlier. I can't see why=20
draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch-01 would take any longer to finalise=20
than draft-thubert-6lo-rpl-nhc-02, especially if the latter would=20
include RH3 as well.

5) Sub-IP protocol

The mesh header as it stands is not significantly different to what is=20
being proposed for 6LoRH as it too could be used to carry IPv6 addresses =

in a compressed format on the basis that link layer addresses are=20
already used with autoconfigured IPv6 addresses. I would therefore see=20
6LoRH as a general more flexible replacement for the mesh header and=20
therefore 6LoRH used in conjunction with RPI/RH3 would not be a sub-ip=20
protocol.

In essence, the difference is really this:

RFC4944:
mesh[0..a] | FRAG1 | IPHC | {IPHC[0..b] | NHC[0..c]}[0..d] | Payload
mesh[0..a] | FRAGN | Payload

draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch-01:
6LoRH[0..a] | FRAG1 | 6LoRH[0..b] | IPHC | {IPHC[0..c] |=20
NHC[0..d]}[0..e} | Payload
6LoRH[0..a] | FRAGN | Payload

All the above really shows is that 6LoRH can be used in place of a mesh=20
header for sub-ip purposes simply as a "less greedy" way or it can be=20
used to replace an IPHC header as used currently in conjunction with a=20
more efficient header extension. If I have one issue, it is calling them =

all "6LoRH" - the RPI can sit a "6LoRH-style" header extension alongside =

an IPHC header if there is no encapsulation, I believe?

This is where I have some sympathy with James Woodyatt's e-mail - the=20
options start to look a little hairy and it becomes significantly more=20
complex to figure out what goes where.

6) Bump-in-the-stack

I have seen both bump-in-the-stack and full decompression/recompression. =

In addition to what Pascal points out, there are some other subtle=20
considerations which need to be applied for BITS, especially with regard =

to eliding what look like padding fields - I have seen one issue where a =

value of 0 was considered to be padding and not included correctly.

<RCC>I don't think it counts as a sub-IP encoding. As Pascal has=20
explained there is a one-to-one correspondence (he used the (I think)=20
equivalent word "biunivocal", which is not a familiar word to me)=20
between the compressed address and an IPv6 address.</RCC>

<RCC>I think when you boil it all down, it doesn't look that much=20
different to what is done in RFC 6282. It is all about placement of the=20
encodings, pivoted around the first/only IPHC encoding. However, I agree =

with James that the permutations of placement are starting to look quite =

complex</RCC>

<RCC>I stlll don't think that makes it sub-IP as the addresses still=20
represent IPv6 addresses</RCC>

Hi Pascal,

I was looking through draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch-01 again and I=20
still find the 'I' bit confusing (especially in conjunction with RPI,=20
where there is another 'I' bit). So I think it would make sense to=20
consider two basic dispatch types. I have nominally called them=20
"Elective" and "Critical" but you may think of better terms. "Elective"
is the I =3D 1 case, where the remaining 5 bits explicitly indicate the=20
length to a parser can choose to skip it if it doesn't understand the=20
type. "Critical" is the I =3D 0 case. I also expanded a bit on the=20
placement of the 6LoRH.

Here is a suggested rewrite of Section 4:

<section>
4.  General Format

     The 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH) reuses the bit patterns that are =

defined in [RFC4944] for the Mesh Header, specifically the Dispatch=20
Value Bit Pattern of 10xxxxxx.  It may contain source routing=20
information such as a compressed form of RH3, or other sorts of routing=20
information such as the RPL RPI, source and/or destination address, and=20
is extensible for future uses, with the given example of BIER bitmap=20
encoding in Section 9.

     There are two forms for 6LoRH:

     o Elective (6LoRHE)
     o Critical (6LoRHC)

4.1 Elective Format (6LoRHE)

     The 6LoRHE uses the Dispatch Value Bit Pattern of 101xxxxx.  A=20
6LoRHE may be ignored and skipped in parsing.  If it is ignored, the=20
6LoRHE is forwarded with no change inside the LLN.

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    .....   +-+
        |1|0|1| Length  |      Type     |              |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    .....   +-+
                                         <-- Length -->

                       Figure 2: Elective 6LoWPAN Routing Header

     Length
           Length of the 6LoRHE expressed in bytes, excluding the first=20
2 bytes. This is done to enable a node to skip a 6LoRH that it does not=20
support and/or cannot parse, for instance if the Type is unknown.

     Type
           Type of the 6LoRHE

4.2 Critical Format (6LoRHC)

     The 6LoRHC uses the Dispatch Value Bit Pattern of 100xxxxx.  A node =

which does not support the 6LoRHC Type MUST silently discard the packet=20
(note that there is no provision for theexchange of error messages; such =

a situation should be avoided by judicious use of administrative control =

and/or capability indications).

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ......................... +-+
        |1|0|0|   TSE   |      Type |                                  |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ......................... +-+
                                         <-- Length implied by Type/TSE -=
->

                       Figure 3: Elective 6LoWPAN Routing Header

     TSE
           Type Specific Extension.  The meaning depends on the Type,=20
which must be known in all of the nodes.  The interpretation of the TSE=20
depends on the Type field that follows. For instance, it may be used to=20
transport control bits, the number of elements in an array, or the=20
length of the remainder of the 6LoRHC expressed in a unit other than byte=
s.

     Type
           Type of the 6LoRHE

4.3 Placement of 6LoRH

     One or more 6LoRHs MAY be placed in a 6LoWPAN packet and MUST=20
always be placed before the LOWPAN_IPHC [RFC6282].  A 6LoRH MAY be used=20
in conjunction with a Fragmentation Type and Header [RFC4944] in three wa=
ys:

     o Before the Fragmentation Type and Header
     o Before and after the Fragmentation Type and Header
     o After the Fragmentation Type and Header

     Headers are processed in order so if a 6LoRH is processed that is=20
sufficient to route a packet, then there is no need for the intermediate =

node to process the packet further.

4.3.1 6LoRH before Fragmentation Type and Header

     | 6LoRH | Frag1 | IPHC | Payload Frag1 |
     | 6LoRH | FragN | Payload Frag2 |
     | 6LoRH | FragN | Payload Frag3 |...

     If a 6LoRH is placed before a Fragmentation Type and Header, the=20
fragments can be routed individually.

4.3.2 6LoRH after Fragmentation Type and Header

     | Frag1 | 6LoRH | IPHC | Payload Frag1 |
     | FragN | Payload Frag2 |
     | FragN | Payload Frag3 |...

     If a 6LoRH is placed after a Fragmentation Type and Header, the=20
fragments cannot be individually routed and the whole IPv6 packet needs=20
to be reassembled at every LLN hop.
</section>

Comments or questions? Given some of the discussion on the mailing list, =

maybe the "Placement of 6LoRH" section could be enhanced further.

Robert

In accordance with: https://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/interim-meetings.ht=
ml
the ROLL Working Group Chairs are announcing a virtual interim meeting for
February 10, 2015, from 15:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC.
      (please see: http://goo.gl/NVefsy to convert the time)

The very draft agenda is in development, and can be seen at:
  http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/interim/2015/02/10/roll/agenda/agenda-int=
erim-2015-roll-1

The goal of this interim meeting is to do a deep technical dive into the
different ways of optimizing the byte/power cost of the RFC6553 (RPI) and
RFC6554 (RH3) options.  This could involve compression or recoding, or???
We invite submissions on this.  Please post your -00 draft by January 23 if
possible, or point us at your other drafts.

We will use JITSI for audio, video and slides, with the following URL:
     https://jitsi.tools.ietf.org/Roll20150210VirtualInterim
  Participants are encouraged to visit this URL in advance to verify that
  it works for them.  If you need another participant to help verify, pleas=
e=20
  email me.

There will be a PSTN bridge for a backup, should things completely fail.
We will have a dial-in phone number connected to the bridge for those that
are unable to connect with a computer, but it won't be toll-free.=20=20
The phone numbers involved will be posted to the agenda as it is finalized,
and we expect to distribute slides by January 27, 2015.

(BTW: we do not believe that ROLL will meet in Dallas/IETF92)

[PTT] The Behave term is "address domain". Initial definition in RFC 
2663, repeated in subsequent documents.

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Carsten,

I just posted -07 with updates to these points (but slightly different upda=
tes than what I proposed below).

Hi Carsten,

Right, I had forgotten the RFC6775 sentence:" the address that is to be reg=
istered MUST be the IPv6 source address of the NS message".=20

In the RFC6282 with SAC=3D1, DAM=3D11 the idea is to derive address from co=
ntext and link-layer address. This would work nicely if addresses were base=
d on Bluetooth Device Address. However, with random IIDs eliding the IID be=
comes more challenging. The idea here is that if a node has registered only=
 one IPv6 address for a prefix, and there's compression context for the pre=
fix, the address could be fully elided as both 6LN and 6LBR would know from=
 the context information that it is this one address that has been elided. =
When multiple addresses would be configured for the same prefix, then the I=
ID part would need to be transmitted inline (and prefix bits would come fro=
m context information).

I guess if 6LBR would have two address registrations for a 6LN and the 6LN =
for some reason would think it has only one, the 6LN might elide its addres=
s and then 6LBR would have problem decompressing.. But I'm not sure how thi=
s situation could arise, as device reboots/Bluetooth disconnections should =
clear related state on both entities, and registration timeouts clear extra=
 entries from 6LBR.

So attempting to elide random IID definitely increases complexity. If we'd =
decide that random IIDs shall be always carrier inline, we'd get simpler so=
lution.. but with more bits transmitted with each packet. Implementations w=
ould then made tradeoff between compression efficiency and privacy (if usin=
g static BDADDR). We could also force just one address registration per pre=
fix, which would support random IIDs and avoid synchronization problems due=
 6LBR refusing to register multiple addresses for the same prefix from the =
same host..=20

Next proposal for the text:
	 1.  A Bluetooth LE 6LN SHOULD NOT register its=20
	 link-local address. A Bluetooth LE 6LN MUST register its non-link-local a=
ddresses
   	 with the 6LBR by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with
    	 the Address Registration Option (ARO) and process the Neighbor
     	 Advertisement (NA) accordingly.  The NS with the ARO option MUST be
    	 sent irrespective of the method used to generate the IID.  If the 6LN
    	 registers multiple addresses per compression context, the 6LN=20
	 and 6LBR will have to send IID bits inline as in that case there is not e=
nough
 	information available for computing back an elided IID.

I thought we should not discuss about semantics of IID:) So would this text=
 be clearer:
--
of 0xFF and 0xFE in the middle of the 48-bit Bluetooth device address as sh=
own in Figure 4.  In the Figure letter 'b' represents a bit from Bluetooth =
device address, copied as is without any changes on any bit.
--

Best regards,

	Teemu

Hi Teemu,

thanks for these updates.

Strictly speaking, the 6LN registers IPv6 addresses, not IIDs, with the 6LB=
R; I like that aspect of the -04 wording better.  I'm still trying to wrap =
my head around the condition for being able to elide the IID part of an add=
ress -- as described in 3.2.3, it is that multiple addresses weren't regist=
ered for a prefix, but it is not quite clear to me how 6LN and 6LBR agree t=
hat this is indeed the case (ARO makes sure an address is registered, but h=
ow do we make sure no other address is still registered?).

Maybe it is also worth pointing out that the procedure described in section=
 3.2.2 (inverting U/L as per appendix A of RFC 4291) is also replaced by th=
e procedures described here -- I'm not sure every implementer will infer th=
at.

Hello,

I wonder why is the length of the IID in draft-ietf-6lo-btle-06.txt set 
to 64 since the BTLE MAC address is just 48bit?

Is there a problem if we set the IID length to 48?

Because if we do, then we may have an advantage in using longer than 64 
prefix lengths in the BTLE subnet - e.g. /65.  This is helpful in 
networks at the very edge of the Internet - typically the prefix 
arriving from the Internet to the 6LBR is is of length 64.  With such a 
prefix arriving to the 6LBR it is practically impossible to create 
another prefix of length also 64 beyond 6LBR, in the BTLE subnet.  Hence 
we'd need a prefix length of /65 in the BTLE subnet.  But a /65 in BTLE 
is impossible if the IID is of length 64.

Let me illustrate this by way of comparison:

                          6LN
                           \              ____________
            /65 impossible  \       /64  /            \
                    6LN ---- 6LBR ----- |  Internet   |
                            /            \____________/
                           /
                          6LN

             - with IID of length 64 -

--------------------------------------------------------------

                          6LN
                           \              ____________
              /65 possible  \       /64  /            \
                    6LN ---- 6LBR ----- |  Internet   |
                            /            \____________/
                           /
                          6LN

             - with IID of length 48 -

Hi Alexandru,

You describe a general problem which I don't think should be solved as part=
 of IPv6 over BLE work.

> Is there a problem if we set the IID length to 48?

There is. I immediately see three:

1)
RFC7421 section 4.3.1 shows that all those stacks IGNORE option with other =
than 64-bit Prefix, right? I don't think embedded stacks support other than=
 64 bit IIDs either =3D> Lack of support on existing stacks =3D> would requ=
ire even more new implementation effort =3D> risks & deployment delays.

RFC7421 section 4.1 shows a long set of standards that mandate 64, and are =
still successful. =3D> No proven working code for other lengths of IID =3D>=
 risks & deployment delays.

RFC7421 "makes no proposal for a change to the IID length." - so there's no=
 RFC that "mandates variable/non-64 length IID for old and/or new IPv6 over=
 Foo" =3D> No requirement even from IETF.

2)
Standardization of a link layer that support longer than /64 bit prefixes c=
auses stacks (at least on devices wishing to support that type of link laye=
r) to be modified to support longer than /64 bit prefixes. It is not a big =
leap then to start requiring other type of link layers to support longer pr=
efixes as well (now that stacks would already have support:-). That could r=
esult e.g. network operators to start providing /88 (as 48 bits for IID is =
enough..) for edge devices (that would happen to be 6LBRs). Hence after a w=
hile we'd end up to same problem but now with 48 bit IIDs instead of 64.

3)
Random IIDs provide less privacy (due 16 bits less to use for randomization=
).

Hence I think the right answer to the problem you mention is deployment and=
 use of DHCPv6 PD. I don't think changing of IID length is the right answer=
 for operators not willing to support DHCPv6 PD.

Teemu

P.S. Shorter IID might help in header compression, as longer part of the ad=
dress used could be covered by compression context prefix

The implementation effort would be necessary indeed - bug correction.

I agree.  In that future we could come up with shorter than 48bit length 
IIDs (i.e. 16bit, or even just one bit, like in IPv4).

But today? The cellular operators currently do not accept that there are 
several devices behind one smartphone; cellular operators only provide

In the past? IPv4 CIDR was invented and stacks had to be modified to 
accommodate IPv4 "IIDs" of length 1.

I agree, shorter IIDs is less crypto capability.  But there may be other 
methods for privacy than crypting the IPv6 addresses.

The IPv6-over-BTLE document may not work with current cellular networks, 
right?

Maybe in your country, in my part of the world, they advertise that you
can feed the whole family from one wireless account. They will even
provide a router to do that. At least in IPv4, so I can not imagine that
changing in IPv6?

Good :-)

YEs, in my part of the world too they sell these cellular wireless
routers with some success.  In IPv4 they do NAT.

These cellular/wifi dont do IPv6.

No surprise, after all, it is specification for IPv6 over BLE;-)

But more seriously, 3GPP uplink is "just" one of many for possible uplink t=
echnologies for IPv6 BLE deployments. Another one, for example, is cable co=
nnection on fixed deployments, such as on homes. And I recall, home IPv6 co=
nnections (where available) are not generally limited to /64.=20

Right, it is BTLE.  But a BTLE network disconnected from the Internet
wouldnt make much sense.  It wouldn't need to use IP at all.

Yes.

YEs, there are many DSL connections which offer /56.

But, when using it with a BTLE network which needs /64 one has to 
perform a routing operation on the DSL box for that /64.  Currently 
there is no automated mechanism to achieve it.  DSL operators do not 
support DHCPv6 PD for devices within homenet, only for the DSL box.

As such, if one assumes the BTLE network to connect to such DSL network 
one  has to tell how is the /64 routed to the BTLE network - maybe 
stating that today people can only do manual static routes on the DSL box.

On another hand, if the IP-BTLE spec said that the IID is 48, then the 
IP-BTLE spec could specify what happens _only_ on the 6LBR (not on the 
DSL box).

I agree, the problem applies to other non-BTLE networks.

I agree.

But a IP-BTLE spec which freezes the IID length to 64 may represent an 
obstacle to deployment, not a help to deployment.

(until the DHCPv6-PD deployment situation changes).

There are cellular operators who do IPv6, but who do not do IPv6 on 
their cellular/wifi devices.

I cant take this as a hint of preparing to do IPv6 on their 
cellular/wifi devices.

Alexandru, I hear your argument, but in my opinion the 64 bit IID continues=
 to be the preferred way forward.

Hi all,
A new draft is submitted, it's about the security bootstrapping architectur=
e and methods for IoT networks that implement IETF protocols (e.g. 6LoWPAN,=
 6lo, RPL, AODV, DSR) over IEEE 802.15.4.

Two types of bootstrapping methods are developed: network level bootstrappi=
ng and joining device level bootstrapping

The link is: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-he-iot-security-bootstrapping=
-00

Your comments are welcome!

Cheers,
Danping

Abstract:
   Network level security bootstrapping and joining device level
   security bootstrapping mechanisms are described in this document.
   They are proposed for security bootstrapping of the Internet of
   Things networks, which implement IETF protocols (e.g. 6LoWPAN, 6lo,
   RPL, AODV, DSR) over IEEE 802.15.4.  The network level security
   bootstrapping is useful at the very beginning of a newly deployed IoT
   network.  It automatically and hierarchically adds all the devices to
   security domain and helps establish security communication.  The
   joining device level security bootstrapping provides comprehensive
   mechanism for different IoT devices joining an existing IoT network.

> Alexandru, I hear your argument, but in my opinion the 64 bit IID =
continues to be the preferred way forward.

indeed. while we have HNCP and DHCP PD, it might be time to look at the =
problem of extending a network again. a second look at MLSR perhaps? =
that's not a problem that should be solved in an IP over foo document =
though.

cheers,
Ole

But is an IP-over-foo document having a right to _freeze_ an Interface

I thought an IP address was an opaque value?

Yes, but should we continue that way?

Why can't we just say that an Interface ID has a variable length?

But it is not opaque as long as we say that the last 64bits are an 
Interface ID, which itself has a frozen length.

My remark is not trying to change the IPv6 addressing model in general. 
  This remark is about IP-over-BTLE for SLAAC; and I have same remark to 
the IP-over-NFC document as well.

This IPv6-over-BTLE document states that the IID length in BTLE is 64bit 
even though the BTLE address is 48bit, and SLAAC can work with 48bit IIDs.

This IPv6-over-BTLE document states that the constant 0xfffe must be 
inserted even though no receiver interprets this value.

I remark that there is no technical reason to do so.

Hello,

I wonder why is the length of the IID in draft-ietf-6lo-btle-06.txt set 
to 64 since the BTLE MAC address is just 48bit?

Is there a problem if we set the IID length to 48?

Because if we do, then we may have an advantage in using longer than 64 
prefix lengths in the BTLE subnet - e.g. /65.  This is helpful in 
networks at the very edge of the Internet - typically the prefix 
arriving from the Internet to the 6LBR is is of length 64.  With such a 
prefix arriving to the 6LBR it is practically impossible to create 
another prefix of length also 64 beyond 6LBR, in the BTLE subnet.  Hence 
we'd need a prefix length of /65 in the BTLE subnet.  But a /65 in BTLE 
is impossible if the IID is of length 64.

Let me illustrate this by way of comparison:

                          6LN
                           \              ____________
            /65 impossible  \       /64  /            \
                    6LN ---- 6LBR ----- |  Internet   |
                            /            \____________/
                           /
                          6LN

             - with IID of length 64 -

--------------------------------------------------------------

                          6LN
                           \              ____________
              /65 possible  \       /64  /            \
                    6LN ---- 6LBR ----- |  Internet   |
                            /            \____________/
                           /
                          6LN

             - with IID of length 48 -

Hi Alex and others,

There's advantages and disadvantages.
My knee-jerk reaction with co-chair hat on is to note that evaluating this =
needs to  involve the 6man working group. But then I realize that we're in =
the enviable position of having their position stated very clearly in the b=
rand-new RFC7421:
  =20
   ...However, the consensus of the IETF is that the
   benefits of keeping the length fixed at 64 bits and the practical
   difficulties of changing it outweigh the arguments for change.

Gabriel

Hi Alex and others,

There's advantages and disadvantages.
My knee-jerk reaction with co-chair hat on is to note that evaluating this =
needs to  involve the 6man working group. But then I realize that we're in =
the enviable position of having their position stated very clearly in the b=
rand-new RFC7421:
  =20
   ...However, the consensus of the IETF is that the
   benefits of keeping the length fixed at 64 bits and the practical
   difficulties of changing it outweigh the arguments for change.

Gabriel

Hi Ana:

Thanks for your note below. Since your draft cross-references draft-struik-6tisch-security-architectural-considerations-01, your comments and observations on this would be most welcome.

Best regards, Rene

Hello Gabriel,

Thank you for the message.

I am not trying at changing a decision.

Please allow me an argumentation for the sake of argumentation.

That 6man RFC is INFORMATIONAL only.  During that 6man discussion some 
opinion were against the paragraph cited below.  Also, there's a v6ops 
WG item which states that the forwarding happens on netmasks up to 128 
(which would be impossible with SLAAC and IIDs of length 64) 
(draft-ietf-v6ops-cidr-prefix-00.txt).

Changing implementations may prove difficult if BTLE is used on an 
android platform which inherits the typical linux IPv6 stack.    But it 
may be easy to do on BTLE devices which uses newer and lighter IP stacks.

I dont see in the immediate any interoperability problem if the IID were 
48 in BTLE.

My last message on this, thanks.

Alex

Sections 4.1 and 4.2 in that draft are a good catalog of existing problems=
=E2=80=94
in my opinion, the most obviously relevant ones, in order of decreasing
importance, would be NAT64, IKE, CGA and Mobile IP. Not to mention the
predictable outcome that future IETF and external standards will come to
expect on-link network prefixes always to be 64 bits, so it's therefore
important to keep 6BLE from becoming a divergence in that respect.

Hi Rene,
Thank you for your reply. It would be great if you have any comments on my =
draft ^_^.  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-he-iot-security-bootstrapping-=
00
We can also discuss more on the security topics for 6lo or 6tisch environme=
nt.

I took a quick review on your draft, the description is clear. The architec=
ture you proposed not only covers the secure joining (authentication) issue=
, but also covers other issues like authorization.
A main problem of your solution may be the neighbor node, which is an authe=
nticator as well as a proxy. For a constrained node, even a FFD, the authen=
tication task is too heavy, imagine that devices from different vendor can =
join the same domain.
Thoughts?=20

Ps. I need more time to think about the authorization architecture mentione=
d in your draft

Regards,
Ana

Hello 6loWG:


As you know that Bluetooth SIG specification work associated with the follo=
wing draft had been completed. The reference can be found at http://www.iet=
f.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/msg00851.html.  Following the Bluetooth =
specification update on Internet Protocol Support Profile, the following dr=
aft has been updated a few times by the co-authors and reviewed by the docu=
ment shepherd, Carsten Boremann,

The document was previously in IESG review but now it will go through the W=
GLC  and IESG review again due to the relevant changes.

Please review the  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-btle-07  docum=
ent and provide your comments to the 6lo list by Feb 6, 2014.

Thank you.

-Samita

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Abstract:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy=
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetoot=
h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Interest Group.&nbsp; The standard Bluetooth radio has=
 been widely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers=
, audio<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; headsets and many other devices.&nbsp; The low power version o=
f Bluetooth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a specification that enables the use of this air interface =
with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.&nbsp; =
The low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision =
4.0 of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is=
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required for IPv6.&nbsp; This document describes how IPv6 is t=
ransported<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.<br>

Hello 6lo WG:

NFC technology has been widely implemented and used in many different devic=
es and laptops and smart phones.
The co-authors of the 6lo-ipv6-over-nfc has been presented at IETF 90 and I=
ETF91 6lo meetings and updated the documents from WG comments.
>From the WG meetings, the members expressed interests in working on this do=
cument.

With the chair-hat on, I  believe this document requires more work  to move=
 forward, if adopted as a WG document.

As per request of the co-authors of the following document, the 6lo-chairs =
like to request adoption for the following work:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hong-6lo-ipv6-over-nfc-03


Please note, the adoption call ends at Feb 6, 2014.

Thanks,
-Samita

Hello all:

I am not able to find the meeting minutes at the IETF91 proceedings page. R=
alph and I reviewed the meeting minutes and merged before the December brea=
k. While we are working on updating the minutes on the IETF91 page, here is=
 a copy.

Thanks a lot to our minute takers Markus and Ines.

Hi Ana:

Thanks for your note. Indeed, in the draft, the neighbor node has a role 
that stretches further than simply relaying messages. Right now, the 
"weakened" role of neighbor node as relay node only is alluded to in 
remark #6 of section 1.3.3 of 
draft-struik-6tisch-security-architectural-considerations-01:

    The join protocol above can also be "weakened", e.g., by
    removing authentication of the neighbor node to the joining node
    or vice-versa. As already said, this might open the protocol to
    wide-spread denial of service attacks on the network (in case
    the neighbor node simply forwards any joining node traffic,
    without inspection) or denial of service attacks on the joining
    node (in case the neighbor node is a bogus node or a node of an
    alien network). In some settings, though, practical trade-offs
    may favor such a "weakened" approach, e.g., if one wishes to
    "sprinkle" in sufficiently many neighbor nodes to guarantee
    connectivity to the server during initial deployment. If so,
    one should still have a fall-back strategy in place should
    denial of service attacks become a reality. (NOTE: These
    "weakened" versions will be analyzed in more detail in a later
    version of this draft.)

As suggested, this will be examined in greater detail in a later version 
of the draft.

Best regards, Rene

We can also discuss more on the security topics for 6lo or 6tisch environment.

I took a quick review on your draft, the description is clear. The architecture you proposed not only covers the secure joining (authentication) issue, but also covers other issues like authorization.
A main problem of your solution may be the neighbor node, which is an authenticator as well as a proxy. For a constrained node, even a FFD, the authentication task is too heavy, imagine that devices from different vendor can join the same domain.
Thoughts? 

Ps. I need more time to think about the authorization architecture mentioned in your draft

Abstract:
    Network level security bootstrapping and joining device level
    security bootstrapping mechanisms are described in this document.
    They are proposed for security bootstrapping of the Internet of
    Things networks, which implement IETF protocols (e.g. 6LoWPAN, 6lo,
    RPL, AODV, DSR) over IEEE 802.15.4.  The network level security
    bootstrapping is useful at the very beginning of a newly deployed IoT
    network.  It automatically and hierarchically adds all the devices to
    security domain and helps establish security communication.  The
    joining device level security bootstrapping provides comprehensive
    mechanism for different IoT devices joining an existing IoT network.

Hi Ralph,

Thanks for reviewing the draft and providing valuable feedback. The changes=
 will be implemented in a new revision of the draft that soon will be uploa=
ded. See my inline comments below.

Thanks and best regards,
  Jens


-----Original Message-----
From: 6lo [mailto:6lo-bounces@ietf.org] On Behalf Of Ralph Droms (rdroms)
Sent: 6. november 2014 20:22
To: 6lo@ietf.org WG
Subject: [6lo] Comments on draft-ietf-6lo-dect-ule-00

I have a few comments on draft-ietf-6lo-dect-ule-00.  Additional review and=
 comment welcome... =20

Content:

I'm curious about why the specification goes in to specifics about the use =
of various forms of RFC 6282 header compression.  Would it be sufficient to=
 specify that IPv6-over-DECT ULE uses RFC 6282 header compression and leave=
 it to the deployment to choose the forms of compression in use?  Are there=
 any details about the use of RFC 6282 header compression that should be no=
ted as specific to IPv6-over-DECT ULE.
[jens]: Three reasons mainly: 1.: DECT-ULE is star topology and we want to =
be specific on the features in RFC6282 that is used. 2.: We want to mandate=
 compression of headers with address elision as much as possible. Just stat=
ing that RFC6282 shall be used leaves the possibility of not compression at=
 all. Also, mandating some of RFC6282's features removes the need to implem=
ent the alternative ones, allowing for simpler coder. 3.: Our layer 2 addre=
ss is not an IEEE MAC-48 address. Therefore, RFC6282 is not enough to descr=
ibe the full process of address elision. We have to go through the Neighbou=
r Cache to reconcile Device Address and IID (the same applies to BT-LE in t=
he general case). However, we can probably optimize and compress some of th=
e text and add some more references to RFC6282.

In section 3.2.4, does this document specify that the link-local IPv6 addre=
sses are to be entirely elided, or compressed (which turns out to be elided=
 except for the RFC 6282 header bits)?
[jens]: The intention is that link-local addresses are entirely elided. I w=
ill check the wording in the description.

This document may need to make some mention of draft-ietf-6man-default-iids=
, depending on the progress of that document through the 6man WG.
[jens]: Agreed, it would be appropriate to mention draft-ietf-6man-default-=
iids. Will be implemented in next revision.

Editorial:

In section 3.2.3, the use of "unicast" and "multicast" wasn't clear to me; =
specifically when do those terms apply to L2 and L3.
[jens]: Agreed when reading with fresh eyes. The description will be change=
d and rephrased.=20

Section 2.1, para 5: s/Depending of/Depending on/
[jens]: Ok

Section 3.2, para 1: I suggest simply writing out FAR rather than using the=
 abbreviation.
[jens]: Agreed, will be implemented in next revision

Perhaps define 6LBR and 6LN in section 1.2 rather than in-line?
[jens]: Agreed, will be implemented in next revision

Abstract:
   DECT Ultra Low Energy is a low power air interface technology that is
   defined by the DECT Forum and specified by ETSI.

   The DECT air interface technology has been used world-wide in
   communication devices for more than 20 years, primarily carrying
   voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed for data
   centric services.

   The DECT Ultra Low Energy is a recent addition to the DECT interface
   primarily intended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as
   sensor devices, smart meters, home automation etc.  As the DECT Ultra
   Low Energy interface inherits many of the capabilities from DECT, it
   benefits from long range, interference free operation, world wide
   reserved frequency band, low silicon prices and maturity.  There is
   an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE
   such as for Internet of Things applications.

   This document describes how IPv6 is transported over DECT ULE using
   6LoWPAN techniques.

I have added a number of CCs, I think that this fits into ANIMA best.

I read the document with great interest.
I found that you explained the incremental boot-strapping process quite wel=
l,
and nobody has clearly articulated the process yet.  People have just assum=
ed
that everyone knows this process, but really it needs to get written down, =
so
I thank you for doing that.

Given that:

   Because IEEE 802.15.4 maximum payload size is 128 Bytes, a standard
   security bootstrapping protocol should be light-weight with low
   complexity.  The protocol must allow for commissioning of devices

I was surprised that the draft then suggested EAP with PANA as a transport:

   If EAP is used, PANA can be used to relay the authentication message
   from configured FFDs to 6LBR.  If the validation is successful, the
   IP address and network key are generated and delivered to the FFD.

But, EAP-TLS with PANA is exactly what the Zigbee IP specification has
specified.  Do you envision any changes from that specification?
A minority of people had prefered this mechanism for 6tisch-security, but
none stepped forward to write up that mechanism.   Perhaps this draft could
fulfill that need?

You write that the IP address would be generated; usually that occurs via
distribution of PIOs via ND (router-adveristments) or RPL.  Were you going =
to
suggest something else here?

From=20the ANIMA and 6tisch-security point of view, my view is that this is=
 all
about the choice of certificates for the TLS setup.  Do you have any view on
how that might work?

The 6tisch-security bootstrap process aims to create a
YANG/CBOR-over-CoAP-over-DTLS session between a Join Coordinator and the
Joining Node: over that management link, security (and timeslot scheduling)
would be provisioned.
