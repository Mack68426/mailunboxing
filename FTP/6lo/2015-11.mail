Hi 6man, 6lo and dnsop folks,

There will be a talk about IoT DNS Name Autoconfiguration
in 6man WG's morning session tomorrow, 11/4/2015.

Title: DNS Name Autoconfiguration for Internet of Things Devices
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jeong-6man-iot-dns-autoconf-00

I hope we discuss how to configure the DNS names of IoT devices in
networks,
such as home network, enterprise network, road network, and factory network
with the minimum configuration effort.

Imagining that you have hundreds of IoT devices in your network,
will you configure their DNS names manually one by one?

To prepare for the new wave of IoT networks based on IPv6,
we need to think of the DNS naming and auto-registration into DNS for IoT
devices.

We (SKKU and Jubix) implemented a prototype for a smart grid with electric
meters
Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) that is the main power delivery
company in South Korea.
Our meters are running on IPv6/6lo/Wi-SUN (IEEE 802.15.4g).

Since I have 5 minutes for the presentation tomorrow, I will shortly
introduce the motivation,
the DNS name format based on the ITU-T/ISO object identifier, and our
protocol.

Please read my draft and slides in the 6man agenda link:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/94/agenda.html

The slides has the backup slides (as Appendix slides) that explain
the implementation and demonstration, and also the comparison with mDNS.

Thanks for reading this email.

Best Regards,
Paul

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Greetings,

To begin finalizing the Security Considerations section of draft-ietf-6lo-
6lobac, i thought it would be useful to re-read and offer my review of
draft-ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations-00.

First, some general comments:

- I find the document clear and understandable, as per Dave's usual.

- As this document pertains to constrained devices, I think some of the
concerns expressed in other fora (e.g. leaking link-local address in
email headers) don't apply here.

- I think it would be helpful to clearly divide the document according to
threats posed by off-link vs on-link adversaries.  In the off-link case,
we are dealing only with routable addresses and information that is
at L3 or higher.  This class of threats applies to all hosts, including 6lo.
Using a random 60+ bit IID (per prefix?) will mitigate all threats
discussed in draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy except
correlation of activity over time.

In the on-link case, are we only concerned with threats that apply to
(wireless) data links that are susceptible to eavesdropping, or must we
also be concerned with intruders in the wiring closet?  In any event, this
class of threats would seem to exclude address scanning (which is trivial
if an attacker has access to the local link traffic).

- If address scanning is eliminated as a concern (as in cases where it
cannot be prevented), then arguments about "enough entropy" do not
apply and locally assigned short addresses have their rightful place in
forming link-local IIDs.  The side effect of this is to enable maximally
efficient RFC 6282 compression for link-local traffic.

- Concerns about correlation over time may not apply to certain classes
of devices (fixed servers) or applications (e.g. building automation, where
associating link-layer address with location is a feature, not a bug).  In
some cases, it may simply be impractical to change link-layer address
on a frequent basis (e.g. it is common in the case of MS/TP nodes to set
the L2 address via DIP switches).

- It has been suggested that ND might be eliminated in some cases to
further increase bandwidth efficiency.  (For example, in cases where a
locally-assigned short identifier has been assigned at L2 and is then
used to form an IID, ND is redundant.)  AFAIK, there hasn't been any
discussion about how to tell the difference between L2-derived and
"random" IIDs.  We might identify L2-derived IIDs as those containing
the 0xFFFE pattern in the middle, or not having the 0xFFFE pattern but
having the U/L bit = 1 in the IID.  This would exclude these patterns from
valid privacy IIDs and result in a maximum entropy of ~63 bits.


Now on to specifics:

- In section 2, I think the analysis pertains to the lifetime of a given
link
so the wording "average lifetime of a device" should instead be "average
lifetime of a link".

It is worth noting that CoAP servers do not have a "stealth mode".
According to [RFC7252] a CoAP server MUST respond to an empty
Confirmable message with a Reset message.

- In section 3, MS/TP has 7 or 64 bits (since L2 addresses must be in
the range 0 - 127).

- Section 3.1 seems to alternately switch between discussing link-layer
addresses and IIDs formed from those addresses.  Perhaps consistent
use of "link identifier" and "interface identifier" would help disambiguate
the meaning.

EUI-64 and EUI-48 are well-defined terms (trademarked in fact, and
this should be noted in the document).  An EUI-64 may have 40, 36, or
28 bits of entropy, while an EUI-48 may have 24, 20, or 12 bits, none
of which meet the standard of "at least 46 bits".  I'm not sure it's
accurate to use "randomized IEEE identifiers", unless this refers to
locally-assigned MAC addresses with the U/L bit = 1, in which case we
might want to reference an appropriate IEEE 802 or ISO standard.

- In Section 4, first bullet, it should be enough to indicate that privacy
IIDs are RECOMMENDED for routable addresses.  (Is there a case
where a privacy IID is less than ~63 bits of entropy?)  This section
should also discuss options for providing privacy IIDs via DHCPv6
(M=1 in RA).

Second bullet - as I've indicated above, there's no such thing as a
"random" EUI-64 or EUI-48.  We can probably use "randomized MAC
addresses".  I need to go back and re-read [RFC7136] to see if it makes
sense to specify U/L bit in this context.

Third bullet - this advice should not apply to link-local IIDs.  Any
attacker
wishing to find "hits" just needs to fire up a sniffer.

Fourth bullet - this advice should not apply to link-local IIDs for devices
or applications where correlation of activities over time is not a concern.

HTH, Kerry

Hello Dan,

I'd see it useful to give this a lot of visibility and accessibility. A BoF=
-type meeting outside of meeting hours at this or the next IETF would proba=
bly improve that piece. INTAREA has collisions that people did not necessar=
ily get a chance to manage in advance so interested people may miss the pre=
sentation.
I would like to be sure that most interested parties have a chance to know =
that this is happening at all.

Some of these discussion will relate to work happening at various WGs. Out =
of my hat and not copied above I see at least 6lo and MANET which deal with=
 radios networks and need efficient network and service discovery. Cc ing 6=
lo because this is where RFC 6775 originated, and new work is taking place.

There will be serious discussions, and probably documents produced in the f=
orm of best practices. This work may deserve a short-termed WG on its own. =
A non-Wg forming BoF would help figure all that out.

Cheers,

Pascal

Hi Pascal,

  I think the multicast-over-wifi discussion will be interesting for folks =
 in 6lo (regarding RFC6775) .

The goal is to reduce the  unnecessary signaling in the protocols and espec=
ially in efficient-nd (discussed in 6man) we had many rounds of discussions=
 on wifi multicast behavior.=20

Fixing 802.11 behavior for multicast will be helpful in many usecases to pr=
operly handle multicast messages.  However, I believe in general the protoc=
ols should reduce multicast signaling in  constrained node networks as well=
 as in environments with virtual networks and VMs.

-Samita

Hello,

I would like to comment with respect to enconding IPv6 EID (Extension 
header ID?).

I am not sure which document defines the EID?  The slide shows 3 bits 
reserved to encode Extension Header types.

But 3 bits can not accommodate 255 possible Extension Headers as listed 
at IANA:

http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters/ipv6-parameters.xhtml

For example, one needs to encode at least the HIP extension header, 
Shim6 extension header, "experimentation and testing extension header".

Alex

Hi Alex,

> I am not sure which document defines the EID?  The slide shows 3 bits
> reserved to encode Extension Header types.

IPv6 Extension Header Compression ID (EID) is defined in RFC6282 (IPHC):
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6282#section-4.2
=20
> But 3 bits can not accommodate 255 possible Extension Headers as listed at
> IANA:
>=20
> http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters/ipv6-parameters.xhtml
>=20
> For example, one needs to encode at least the HIP extension header, Shim6
> extension header, "experimentation and testing extension header".

To my understanding any extension header that has no LOWPAN_NHC encoding
defined in this or any other corresponding RFC has to follow after any
potentially present encoded NHC header in an uncompressed fashion.

Cheers,
Oleg

This was not actually discussed in 6man, 6lo, or dnsop, so I=E2=80=99ll =
make some comments here.

It=E2=80=99s hard to know where to start.

Your document confuses device discovery with service discovery. What a =
device *is* tells you virtually nothing about what it *does*. The =
=E2=80=9Cdevice category=E2=80=9D of my computer being =E2=80=9Claptop=E2=80=
=9D or =E2=80=9Ctablet=E2=80=9D tells you *nothing* about what services =
it offers.

Your document assumes that every search domain your tablet encounters =
(starbucks.com, narita-airport.co.jp, meeting.ietf.org, comcast.com) =
will allow your tablet to create global records in that domain. Clearly =
this is nonsense.

Having put global address records into starbucks.com, your document =
assumes then assumes that starbucks.com will then allow you do to a zone =
transfer to fetch the entire zone to discover the names of all the other =
address records in starbucks.com. Clearly this is nonsense too.

Your document proposes global address records with names with this form:

unique_id.device_model.device_category.mic_loc.mac_loc.domain_name.

For example:

=
jkadjkhdsafhjlsadfjklkljdgajknsadf.Sungkyunkwan-1234.cleaning-robot.right-=
upper-corner.living-room.comcast.com.

The host name of the cleaning robot keeps changing as it moves around =
the room, requiring continual updates and continual zone transfers to =
keep track of the name as it changes. Clearly this is infeasible.

I would, however, love to get one of these new flying cleaning robots, =
which can be located (as it was in your example), =E2=80=9Cin the =

        This is the next step in my draft.
        For example, for a given Samsung's refrigerator model, such as
RF4287HARS
        (28 cu. ft. French Door Refrigerator Stainless Steel), we can know
the functions with the specification.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jeong-6man-iot-dns-autoconf-00#section-7,
        I discuss the mobility issue of an IoT device to receive multiple
search domains.
        Whenever the IoT device recognizes the movement into another
subnet, it can delete its DNS names
        by DNS dynamic update.
        In reality, in public areas (e.g., starbucks and narita airport),
we can disable the automatic DNS name registration
in routers
        because the registration in the public areas makes some privacy
issues.
        We can enable such automatic

functions through dnssd.
        This service discovery is the next step in my draft.
        For example, for a given Samsung's refrigerator model, such as
RF4287HARS
        (28 cu. ft. French Door Refrigerator Stainless Steel), we can know
the functions with the specification.
        See Samsung's refrigerators:

   >> In Section 7 (DNS Name Management for Mobile IoT Devices),

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jeong-6man-iot-dns-autoconf-00#section-7,
        I discuss the mobility issue of an IoT device to receive multiple
search domains.
        Whenever the IoT device recognizes the movement into another
subnet, it can delete its DNS names
        by DNS dynamic update.
        In reality, in public areas (e.g., starbucks and narita airport),
we can disable the automatic DNS name
        registration in routers because the registration in the public
areas makes some privacy issues.
        We can enable such automatic registration in our managed networks,
such as home network, office network,
        smart grid, and factory network.
        Thus, we can prevent your concern for global DNS names from
happening.

        My point is that the physical location in the DNS name can help
users easily track the position of an IoT device.

I do not disagree, that is the logical conclusion.  Any such header 
(e.g. shim6) will not be compressed, and supposedly not covered by IPsec 
either if I understand correctly.  There may not necessarily be a 
use-case for e.g. shim6 in 6lo networks anyways.

Mr Jeong,

Over the last year you have asked the IETF community for feedback on =
your document on several occasions. Various people have provided =
feedback, yet your document never changes. You just argue that all the =
feedback is wrong, and persist with your original proposal. I=E2=80=99m =
not sure what will be achieved by repeatedly asking for feedback on the =
same unwavering idea.

You suggest above that the software running on a constrained IoT device =
should visit the web page you gave, explore the web site to find some =
document specifying the network functionality provided by the =
refrigerator model, and the network protocol(s) used to access that =
functionality (I, as a human, was unable to find that document myself) =
and then (presumably via some artificial intelligence algorithms) the =
constrained IoT device would write itself a protocol implementation (and =
design itself a corresponding user interface) to control the =
refrigerator. I don=E2=80=99t believe that IoT devices with such =
artificial intelligence capabilities currently exist outside of =
Hollywood movies.

In your slides you focus on the example of interfacing to a smart meter =
over the network (pictured below). But products that do that have been =
available for a while. I already have one in my house, provided at no =
charge to me by my local electricity company. This is not some new =
experimental thing; it=E2=80=99s a mainstream, widely-used product:

=
<http://www.amazon.com/Rainforest-EAGLE-Ethernet-ZigBee-Gateway/dp/B00AII2=
48U>

When a type of product is readily available for purchase, with a variety =
of different models from a variety of different vendors, it=E2=80=99s =
retail, not research.

I believe you could make a much larger contribution by doing something =
new which builds on the foundation provided by RFC 6762 and RFC 6763, =
rather than just doing the same thing a different way.

Stuart Cheshire

All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following two drafts:



Mesh Link Establishment

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kelsey-6lo-mesh-link-establishment/



An Extension to Mesh Link Establishment (MLE) for Host Identity Protocol Di=
et Exchange (HIP DEX)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ohba-6lo-mle-hip-dex/



MLE has been around for a number of years, and recent presentations have sh=
own some interest with upcoming deployments that could benefit from a stabl=
e reference, e.g., the presentation last week mentioned Zigbee NAN and Thre=
ad.



The intended status of these documents is *Experimental* (so they are not s=
tandards-track).



NOTE: MLE currently says informational, so it will change to experimental i=
f adopted going forward.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
ese documents as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on November 23, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

I support the adoption, considering real world needs and deployments.

If the drafts aim at experimental, I'd suggest we fast track them (at least=
 MLE), taking no change that would alter the match to existing implementati=
ons. E.g. complete last call this calendar year.

Cheers,

Pascal

Subject: [6lo] Call for adoption for MLE documents


All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following two drafts:



Mesh Link Establishment

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kelsey-6lo-mesh-link-establishment/



An Extension to Mesh Link Establishment (MLE) for Host Identity Protocol Di=
et Exchange (HIP DEX)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ohba-6lo-mle-hip-dex/



MLE has been around for a number of years, and recent presentations have sh=
own some interest with upcoming deployments that could benefit from a stabl=
e reference, e.g., the presentation last week mentioned Zigbee NAN and Thre=
ad.



The intended status of these documents is *Experimental* (so they are not s=
tandards-track).



NOTE: MLE currently says informational, so it will change to experimental i=
f adopted going forward.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
ese documents as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on November 23, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

   >> Generally speaking, I tried to address useful comments on the
revisions as long as I understand,
        such as location privacy for medical devices and a DNS name format.
        Refer to the recent draft
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jeong-6man-iot-dns-autoconf-00.

        For the location privacy for IoT devices (e.g., medical devices and
smartphone),
        in Section 8, the location of smartphone can be encrypted by a
shared key or public/privacy keys.
        The device category or model can be encrypted based on my proposed
scheme.

        For the DNS name format, though this version does not have the new
format based on Object ID,
        this new name format is proposed in the slide 3 in my presentation
slides (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jeong-6man-iot-dns-autoconf-00)
        is proposed. The slides is attached in this email.

        This new format is based on the standard format of ITU-T and
ISO/IEC for an object, such as IoT device.
        On the next version of my draft, I will reflect this change.

        In this version, the following are the new proposed ones:
        - The global DNS name autoconfiguration as well as the local DNS
name autoconfiguration
          (See Section 5.2.2. DNS Name Collection)

        - The DNS name management for the mobility of IoT devices
          (See Section 7. DNS Name Management for Mobile IoT Devices)

       I discussed with 6lo folks, IoT software engineers, and IoT experts
for my proposed schemes.
       They think that though my proposed one is a simple implementation
extension based on IPv6 ND and NI protocol,
       it is efficient in multi-link network in terms of DNS packet number
and energy consumption because my resolution is based on
       unicast rather than the multicast of mDNS.

       My team at SKKU and Jubix (a startup company in Korea) are working
for simulation and implementation to compare
       the overhead of mDNS and my proposed one (called DNSNA) in terms of
DNS packet number and energy consumption
       in wireless networks (e.g., 6lo networks).

       We have a plan to show the comparison in the next IETF 95 meeting.

   >> The service discovery, which gets information (e.g., services and
functions) from other devices,  is out of scope in our current work.
        Our goal in this draft is to provide a simple DNS name generation
and registration without any intervention of administrators and users.

>    >> The smart grid for KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation) is an
example for DNSNA.
        In addition to such a smart grid, other IoT devices including
wearable devices will be configured with their DNS names without running
mDNS.

        My folk in IoT industry said that their device can run only part of
IPv6 core specification because of the device's constrained capability.
        So he said that DNSNA is preferred over mDNS.
        mDNS is good enough for high capability devices (e.g., computers,
smartphones, and appliances) and high-bandwidth networks (e.g., WiFi),
        but for constrained IoT devices, which are reluctant to using
multicast, DNSNA may be a solution.

   >> I don't say that my DNSNA is the only solution for IoT devices, but
would say that we IETF need to consider a light-weight DNS naming for
        IoT devices in order to deploy IPv6 in the IoT world.
        mDNS may be modified for the IoT world, so I will also consider how
to extend mDNS for this new world along with DNSNA.

        Thanks for your comments again.

        Best Regards,
        Mr. Jaehoon Paul Jeong

Subject: New Non-WG Mailing List: lp-wan -- Low-Power Wide Area
Networking (LP-WAN), also known as LPWA or Low-Rate WAN (LR-WAN)
Date: Tue, 10 Nov 2015 12:05:12 -0800
From: IETF Secretariat <ietf-secretariat@ietf.org>
Reply-To: ietf@ietf.org
To: IETF Announcement List <ietf-announce@ietf.org>

A new IETF non-working group email list has been created.

List address: lp-wan@ietf.org
Archive: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=3Dlp-wan
To subscribe: https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/lp-wan

Purpose:

An LP-WAN has unique constraints, not seen until now - operation in the
ISM bands (unlicensed spectrum), very low throughput (300 bps - 50
kbps), very high density (10 000-100 000 nodes per Access Point (AP)),
infrastructure networks (star topology, no need for routing), AP
diversity (several APs can receive the same signal), coexistence of
public networks (country-wide) and private networks (city, building,
campus). Asymmetric links are also common, with at least one major
technology providing exclusively unidirectional data services.

LP-WANs will form the backbone of major IoT applications related to many
domains, such as Smart City, Smart Metering, ITS and are expected to
connect 3 billion devices by 2020. There are several such LP- WAN radio
technologies (Semtech LoRa, SigFox, Qowisio, others), each having a
proprietary, locked-in, non-standard solution for addressing,
localization, security, provisioning, AAA, etc. This is the case because
the stringent LP-WAN constraints do not allow for classical approaches
to be used as-is.

The goal of this mailing list is to discuss the problems that arise in
LP-WANs and how the IETF-based solutions apply to them. This is the
place to identify the candidate LP-WAN technologies, their specific
constraints and limitations, consider the corresponding IETF approaches,
and discuss the need for profiles or adaptations of the existing solution=
s.

For additional information, please contact the list administrators.

All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following draft:



A Routing Header Dispatch for 6LoWPAN

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch/



This draft solves a problem for ROLL, namely that of compression of RPL art=
ifacts. It also appears to be extensible enough that it could be useful for=
 other scenarios, especially after discussions at IETF 93 in Prague (contex=
t switch approach) and confirmation at IETF 94 in Yokohama.



This document is intended as standards-track.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
is document as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on December 1, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

As a WG member, I support the adoption of this document.

With chair hat on - after adoption it would be good to make a decision whet=
her we should split the document into two. One for generic non-ESC dispatch=
 specification and the 2nd one is for RPL specific definition of the non-ES=
C dispatch. That way, in future any 6lo usecase that wants to use the non-E=
SC dispatch specification can follow the generic document.

Regards,
-Samita

Subject: Call for Adoption for draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch


All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following draft:



A Routing Header Dispatch for 6LoWPAN

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch/



This draft solves a problem for ROLL, namely that of compression of RPL art=
ifacts. It also appears to be extensible enough that it could be useful for=
 other scenarios, especially after discussions at IETF 93 in Prague (contex=
t switch approach) and confirmation at IETF 94 in Yokohama.



This document is intended as standards-track.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
is document as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on December 1, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

Dear Samita:

I agree that the split is a good idea. That way, ROLL can concentrate on th=
e compression of the RPL artifacts themselves while 6lo has more focus on t=
he paging mechanism.

Cheers,

Pascal

As a WG member, I support the adoption of this document.

With chair hat on - after adoption it would be good to make a decision whet=
her we should split the document into two. One for generic non-ESC dispatch=
 specification and the 2nd one is for RPL specific definition of the non-ES=
C dispatch. That way, in future any 6lo usecase that wants to use the non-E=
SC dispatch specification can follow the generic document.

Regards,
-Samita

Subject: Call for Adoption for draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch


All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following draft:



A Routing Header Dispatch for 6LoWPAN

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch/



This draft solves a problem for ROLL, namely that of compression of RPL art=
ifacts. It also appears to be extensible enough that it could be useful for=
 other scenarios, especially after discussions at IETF 93 in Prague (contex=
t switch approach) and confirmation at IETF 94 in Yokohama.



This document is intended as standards-track.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
is document as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on December 1, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)
--W0jwwH4vGFGnFfpu4REiK1DkLbDXHiu0f
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I saw no opposition to adoption and significant support for adoption.
The authors should publish the next version as a 6lo WG draft.

Regards,
Brian

Subject: [6lo] Call for adoption for MLE documents


All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following two drafts:



Mesh Link Establishment

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kelsey-6lo-mesh-link-establishment/<=
https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=3Dhttps%3a%2f%2fdatatrac=
ker.ietf.org%2fdoc%2fdraft-kelsey-6lo-mesh-link-establishment%2f&data=3D01%=
7c01%7cGabriel.Montenegro%40microsoft.com%7c64724fd755b04376bf1708d2e96384b=
0%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=3DoKOYVxNfSs3uTFKcmRnD47U7Ar=
4Lsp%2bYB0Y8HAtYnho%3d>



An Extension to Mesh Link Establishment (MLE) for Host Identity Protocol Di=
et Exchange (HIP DEX)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ohba-6lo-mle-hip-dex/<https://na01.s=
afelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=3Dhttps%3a%2f%2fdatatracker.ietf.org%2=
fdoc%2fdraft-ohba-6lo-mle-hip-dex%2f&data=3D01%7c01%7cGabriel.Montenegro%40=
microsoft.com%7c64724fd755b04376bf1708d2e96384b0%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7c=
d011db47%7c1&sdata=3Dh8Fg8xFQiM2O%2f8Dj6WYKVIqim%2fEmahNMeilm5%2by8Cj4%3d>



MLE has been around for a number of years, and recent presentations have sh=
own some interest with upcoming deployments that could benefit from a stabl=
e reference, e.g., the presentation last week mentioned Zigbee NAN and Thre=
ad.



The intended status of these documents is *Experimental* (so they are not s=
tandards-track).



NOTE: MLE currently says informational, so it will change to experimental i=
f adopted going forward.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
ese documents as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on November 23, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

Hi,

I currently try to work with 6CO option fields, etc. for Linux 6LoWPAN. I
would give it a try and ask here if somebody knows an (maybe open source)
implementation which supports anything from rfc6775. So I would have
something to test again my implementation.

Thanks in advance.

- Alex

I guess you are aware of the implemention in RIOT [1], right?

Cheers,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
 This draft is a work item of the IPv6 over Networks of Resource-constrained Nodes Working Group of the IETF.

        Title           : An Extension to Mesh Link Establishment (MLE) for Host Identity Protocol Diet Exchange (HIP DEX)
        Author          : Yoshihiro Ohba
	Filename        : draft-ietf-6lo-mle-hip-dex-00.txt
	Pages           : 11
	Date            : 2015-11-24

Abstract:
   HIP DEX (Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange) is a light-weight key
   exchange protocol designed for constrained devices.  MLE (Mesh Link
   Establishment) is defined for establishing and configuring secure
   links in IEEE 802.15.4 mesh networks.  This document defines an
   extension of MLE protocol to encapsulate HIP DEX key exchange
   protocol messages.

Thanks, I wasn't aware that RIOT supports it. Since I have some RIOT
nodes here it would be my first choice.

Any other implementation known?

btw:

Did RIOT already test this rfc6775 implementation stuff somehow with other
implementations?

Hello,

There is also an implementation for Contiki available [1], standalone or 
with RPL integration. It's still in a fork but we hope to make a PR once 
the remaining bugs are tackled.

Kind regards,
Laurent.

Hi,

I'm approve the adoption, this will give more flexibility to manage

Hi,

Yes I approve the publication, this is an important step to manage a large
number of nodes. It should not be restricted to LLN but is useful in all
managed networks.

I've some remarks concerning the document:

- figure 1: add 6BBR in the figure
- =C2=A75.1 not only say that it the same as TIO but explain what is done
- The usage of ODAD is not clear to me, does it mean that the sensor may
receive two DAC messages
- List page 17 starts with small cap and capitals letters
- if it is not too late, the node name may be added the EARO for instance
to allow registration in DNS.
- The other router (in fig 1) behavior should be described since it may
also update its ND table.

Laurent

I support the adoption,

This draft makes a difference in the size of data packets in a RPL LLN, whi=
ch translates impact positively the energy consumption, the delivery ratio =
and the available payload size.

Cheers,

Pascal

Subject: [6lo] Call for Adoption for draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch


All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following draft:



A Routing Header Dispatch for 6LoWPAN

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch/



This draft solves a problem for ROLL, namely that of compression of RPL art=
ifacts. It also appears to be extensible enough that it could be useful for=
 other scenarios, especially after discussions at IETF 93 in Prague (contex=
t switch approach) and confirmation at IETF 94 in Yokohama.



This document is intended as standards-track.



Please send your opinion ("Yes" or "No") to the mailing list on adopting th=
is document as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on December 1, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

I support the adoption;

the I-Draft addresses issues of interest for 6TiSCH as illustrated by the 6=
TiSCH architecture (https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-6tisch-architecture-=
09.txt) that has numerous references to this work.

Cheers,

Subject: [6lo] Call for adoption on draft-thubert-6lo-backbone-router-03

Hello All:

This is an  WG adoption call for draft-thubert-6lo-backbone-router-03 that =
 adds extension to RFC 6775 for a particular topology which creates a large=
 multi-link subnet and the backbone router serves as the 6lowpan Border Rou=
ter.

The document has been around for a while and recently 6tisch WG needs this =
solution for a deployment architecture.

The document is located at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thubert-6lo-ba=
ckbone-router-03. This document is intended as standards-track.

Please review the document carefully and provide feedback. Please respond[ =
yes/no] to the WG alias  whether you support the document as a WG document =
in 6lo.

The adoption call ends on December 2, 2015.

Best regards,
-Samita

Hi Pascal,

I certainly support the adoption even with respect to the upcoming 6tisch WG
activities since bit savings are desirable in LLNs. Thanks a lot for the 
draft!

There could however be one view that, as we are predominantly moving towards
centralized routing and scheduling based architecture, managed through PCE
installed routes and tracks, the role of distributed routing may somewhat be
diminished. This is not imply RPL goes away as there are always going to be
scenarios to carry IP traffic. The counter argument for this line of 
argument
is that if the soft cells left at LLN's disposal are indeed going to be at
premium, why not these be better utilized ? The draft is going to be 
extremely
useful. What do you say ?

Anand

I support the adoption,



This draft makes a difference in the size of data packets in a RPL LLN,
which translates impact positively the energy consumption, the delivery
ratio and the available payload size.

Subject: [6lo] Call for Adoption for draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch



All,



This starts a 6lo Working Group adoption call for the following draft:



A Routing Header Dispatch for 6LoWPAN

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thubert-6lo-routing-dispatch/



This draft solves a problem for ROLL, namely that of compression of RPL
artifacts. It also appears to be extensible enough that it could be
useful for other scenarios, especially after discussions at IETF 93 in
Prague (context switch approach) and confirmation at IETF 94 in Yokohama.



This document is intended as standards-track.



Please send your opinion (Yes or No) to the mailing list on adopting
this document as a 6lo WG document.



This call will end at 00:00 UTC on December 1, 2015.



Regards,

Chairs

Hello,

I support the adoption of this draft as a 6lo WG document, It is important
to reduce the number of bytes send in the LLN's. Thanks for this work

There are one thing to be discussed about the same values used for the IPv6
datagram in page 0 and page 1. Perhaps it could be enough to separate the
information of the dispatches in each pages without have the information
twice. It is only necessary to make a distinction between MESH 10xxxxxx and
RH could be allocated, so you can use page 0 when Mesh is not present.


The general idea of this draft is totally in accordance what it is need in
the lowpan networks.


Ana
