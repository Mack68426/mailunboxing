I would say this is a serious understatement of the mesh header renovation
proposal [option 1]. It's not relevant whether the renovation "deprecates"
the Mesh Header dispatch type selector codes. It's enough to redefine them
without considering backward compatibility. That has a profound effect.
Sufficiently profound that I would argue that marking RFC 4944 as Obsolete
would be entailed.

Accepting the mesh header renovation proposal goes beyond making it
impossible to operate both mesh-under and route-over in the same PANID. It
also makes it impossible to build hardware or microcoded implementations of
6LoWPAN capable of operating in either mode without being configured first
with an operating parameter to distinguish between them. No standard way of
announcing this operational parameter is described in the mesh header
renovation proposal.

Furthermore the mesh header renovation proposal implies that hardware and
microcode implementations may claim to be compliant with the revised
standard, which includes the renovation, despite not supporting the current
standard in RFC 4944 [which, as I say, would seem to need marking as
Obsolete], and this could bring undesirable fragmentation in the technical
ecology, i.e. when I'm building a new device, I may choose at manufacturing
time which of the two standards the device can support=E2=80=94 by selectin=
g the
appropriate part or by burning in the appropriate microcode=E2=80=94 but I =
may not
be able to support both modes in a single unit, even with a software
cut-out to enable the older mesh header standard.

This is why we need to use the Liaison Statement process and the IESG
review if we are to give serious consideration to the mesh header
renovation proposal. It's not a trivial step to redefine the Mesh Header
dispatch type selector codes, and if the proposal is to be seriously
considered, then it must be carefully scrutinized by the IESG and all the
external standards organizations with an interest in 6LoWPAN.

Yes, and there never has been a standard way of announcing the use (and
the purported semantics) of the RFC 4944 mesh header either, so nothing
would change in that respect.  As defined in RFC 4944, the mesh header
is an empty shell, to be filled in by a specific agreement that all
interoperating nodes in a mesh need to be aware of before they can start
using it.
Again, no change at all by the new proposal, except that the syntax now
would also be allowed to change with that special agreement.

If those who want to use the old syntax would actually tell what they
plan to use it for, there might maybe be a basis for some argument.  I
still haven't seen anything but political maneuvering.  Why is it so
hard to argue at a technical level?

G3-PLC is defined in ITU-T G.9903, published by SG-15.  =46rom my =

> ITU-T G.9903

Thanks for bringing this discussion to a technical level.  So this
document has allocated the dispatch code ESC (RFC 6282's value of
01_000000) for the specific purposes of G.9903 ("command frames").  We
probably should add a comment to the IANA registry [1] that this code is
not available in G.9903-based networks.  (I can't seem to find the
liaison statement that alerted IETF to this allocation; however, another
part of that document mentions that "IANA consideration" is "for further
study", so that might still come.)

The other interesting observation is that G.9903 always seems to use the
mesh header with V=1 and F=1 (i.e., the dispatch region used is
10_11XXXX).  This might coincide with the purported plan by the Thread
Group to use the Mesh Header (of which I unfortunately know no details).

I'm not an expert on G.9903 (in particular, I don't understand the
interaction between its Annex E and RFC 6775; the latter only seems to
be reference for the HC area context distribution), but it seems to me
this is exactly a case where pre-configured knowledge of the way the
mesh header is intended to be used, is a prerequisite to being able to
use it ("a 6LoWPAN device requires a set of pre-deployed information,
called a LoWPAN information base(LIB), ..."; similarly, there is an
"Adaptation sublayer IB", IB = information base).

Grüße, Carsten

Hi  Behcet, Robert and Carsten:


Thanks for the good discussion. In regards to Application-level security an=
d network access security (securely access the network by proper identifica=
tion/authentication], I am with Robert that we should separate application-=
level security.

I think that the IoT nodes (in our case specifically 6lo nodes) are bootstr=
apped with the other networked nodes that are with higher authority in the =
networks and then peered with others. The applications are then started [ o=
nce they sense some activity at the network-layer] and the applications  th=
en talk to its peers for application-to-application authorization and perha=
ps signature authentication etc.

There might be commonality between the two when the application might be us=
ing a network-level security as part of it security information/identificat=
ion.  In this case, defining an interface between the two makes sense.

Thus, if we consider IoT security in-general (bootstrapping both nodes alon=
g with apps) - certainly APP security is in scope. When it comes to 6lo-nod=
e bootstrapping and access to the networks- APP-level security is out of sc=
ope ( for 6lo WG).

Having said that, I wonder if any of you have any particular proposal in mi=
nd ?

Thanks,
-Samita

[...] It is fine to state
a policy where network access authorization implies application layer
authorization but the two concepts should be kept separate. There are
many cases where one does not imply the other.

So in the first instance, I think we should probably focus on security
surrounding network access.

Hi Robert,

certainly, the two (authorization to enter the network, application authori=
zation) should not be conflated.

However, the fact that one kind of authorization does not imply the other d=
oes not mean that they will always be set up separately.

There is little point in putting up a sensor in the network and then being =
unable to configure it further because no application security was set up f=
or the configuration resources.

Gr??e, Carsten

In my opinion, G.9903 defines the values 0x01-0x1f in the byte following =
the ESC Dispatch Type.  The other values are still available for use in =
other protocols.

I suggest we actively engage ITU-T SG-15 to publish a very short RFC =
establishing a new IANA registry for the codepoints in the byte =
following the ESC Dispatch Type.  This registry would define 0x01-0x1f =
as "G.9903 Command ID values" and mark the other codepoints as =
"available for assignment".

BTW, I'm now the IAB Liaison Oversight manager.  I've alerted Scott =
Mansfield to the issue.  The 6lo chairs/secretary, Scott and I will get =
in touch with ITU-T SG-15 regarding the registry.

As far as I can tell, G.9903 uses the MESH Dispatch Type according to =
the definition in RFC 6282.  I don't think any speculation about the use =
of the Dispatch Type codepoints by the Thread Group is relevant to this =
discussion of G.9903.

Here, I think we disagree.  I don't see how any internal configuration =
can be used to select how bits in a protocol header can be used.  The =
IETF, in fact, fought long and hard *against* a similar definition of an =
extension to the TCP segment header (Q.flowstatesig).  There is no way, =

That's one way to read it, but not quite the way that I get from a
literal read.
It says (9.4.2.3.1):
»As shown in Figure 9-12, the ADP sublayer command frames are identified
using the ESC header type (see clause 5.1 of [IETF RFC 4944]), followed
by an 8-bit dispatch field indicating the type of ADP command.«
So all 256 values are meant to indicate a specific type of ADP command
frame.  Table 9-35 then goes ahead and allocates 31 values of those;
with a gap, so it identifies some as "Reserved by ITU-T".

(I'm not sure I understand the way G.9905 uses this command frame
concept for source routing; it says the command frame carrying the
source route header is "attached to the packet", but it doesn't quite
tell how both the command frame and the packet are transported, given
that "This header" (the command frame header) "shall be in the last
position if more than one header is present in the 6LowPAN frame."
according to 9.4.2.3.1 of G.9903.  I also don't understand how mesh
headers and those source routes mix, or how a forwarding node knows
where in that source route it is.  Oh well, there is probably nothing
there that 6lo would want to steal, anyway.)

However we read this, I agree that it does make a lot of sense to get
the protocol codes used by ITU-T into the IANA registries, and that we
should work with SG-15 to get this done.

(We do indeed disagree about the usefulness of being able to interpret
protocol syntax when there is no way to act on the semantics required
for handling the packet at all.  Self-describing syntax is certainly
good for wireshark etc., and it helps with hardware implementations.  It
is not a categorical imperative, however.)

Grüße, Carsten

I'll work with Scott Mansfield (ITU-T Liaison Manager), Samita, Gabriel, =
James and the 6lo WG to collaborate with ITU-T SG-15 on establishing an =
appropriate IANA registry.

I've moved the discussion to 6lo to continue this thread.

Can you say more, as I don't understand what you've written and I don't =
have a clue about where "self-describing syntax" fits into the =
discussion.

Hi all,

Concerning the various technical questions exchanged in the previous=20
emails:

We would like to provide some additional details about how ITU-T G.9903=20
a.k.a. G3-PLC uses the mesh header :

1) First of all, G3-PLC provides native mesh under functionnalities (the=20
LOADng protocol, which is described in Annex D of ITU-T G.9903) while not=20
prohibitting other mesh-under (such as CMSR a.k.a. ITU-T G.9905) or=20
route-over routing protocols to be used (in which case native mesh-under=20
LOADng operation is disabled). To us, this simple statement testifies how=20
important the stability of the 6LoWPAN standard suite and related IANA=20
allocation are in the broad G3-PLC/IoT application range.

2) Regarding the ESC dispatch type, G3-PLC exclusively uses it for command =

frames. A command frame is built as follows (depicted in figure 9-12 of=20
the ITU-T G.9903 standard):

- the first octet corresponds to the ESC dispatch header as specified in=20
RFC 6282, i.e. 0b10 000 000.
- the second octet corresponds to the command ID as specified in Table=20
9-35 of ITU-T G.9903 (LOADng command frame, bootstrapping command frame=20
accroding to Annex E, CMSR command frame according to ITU-T G.9905).
- the rest of the frame carries the payload for the relevant command=20
frame.

3) When default LOADng routing is enabled, the mesh header is used for=20
data frames only as specified in RFC 4944

Concerning the ITU-T liaison :

Last Thursday, SG15/Q15 working group agreed to send a liaison to IETF.=20
The liaison statement will be finalized and posted in a couple of days.=20


Best regards,

C=E9dric Lavenu and Thierry Lys

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Hi all,

We received good offline feedback from Erik Rivard regarding some details i=
n the header compression sections, and the feedback is now addressed in thi=
s -12 version.

The changes remove some ambiguities that might have caused interoperability=
 issues, fix an actual bug in CID-field handling, and improve compression p=
erformance in case 6LN is using multitude of non-link-local addresses with =
random IIDs. The multiple addresses for a compression context-case was not =
that well handled in previous draft versions.=20

We don't think the changes are big enough to warrant returning of the docum=
ent to the WG process, but please have a check anyway in case you disagree =
with that assessment.

Best regards,

Teemu

Thanks Teemu for the headsup on the updates.

Question(without reading the latest draft yet): will the compression update=
s using multiple link-local addresses with random IIDs be applicable in gen=
eric  6lo (ipv6-over-foo) cases in your opinion ?

Regards,
-Samita

Hi Thierry,

A quick question on the formation of mesh header in G3-PLC - when it uses 6=
lowpan mesh header , does it use 6LOWPAN_IPHC and ESC dispatch header  with=
 the command frame format in the same packet ?  I assume if that is the cas=
e then ESC header type is placed after 6LOWPAN-IPHC.

Also, could the ESC header with command frame be used without any IPv6 head=
er  in G3-PLC?

Thanks,
-Samita

Subject: [6lo] Possible 6LoWPAN dispatch type deprecation and re-use for ro=
ute over purposes

Hi all,

Concerning the various technical questions exchanged in the previous emails=
:

We would like to provide some additional details about how ITU-T G.9903 a.k=
.a. G3-PLC uses the mesh header :

1) First of all, G3-PLC provides native mesh under functionnalities (the LO=
ADng protocol, which is described in Annex D of ITU-T G.9903) while not pro=
hibitting other mesh-under (such as CMSR a.k.a. ITU-T G.9905) or route-over=
 routing protocols to be used (in which case native mesh-under LOADng opera=
tion is disabled). To us, this simple statement testifies how important the=
 stability of the 6LoWPAN standard suite and related IANA allocation are in=
 the broad G3-PLC/IoT application range.

2) Regarding the ESC dispatch type, G3-PLC exclusively uses it for command =
frames. A command frame is built as follows (depicted in figure 9-12 of the=
 ITU-T G.9903 standard):

- the first octet corresponds to the ESC dispatch header as specified in RF=
C 6282, i.e. 0b10 000 000.
- the second octet corresponds to the command ID as specified in Table 9-35=
 of ITU-T G.9903 (LOADng command frame, bootstrapping command frame accrodi=
ng to Annex E, CMSR command frame according to ITU-T G.9905).
- the rest of the frame carries the payload for the relevant command frame.

3) When default LOADng routing is enabled, the mesh header is used for data=
 frames only as specified in RFC 4944

Concerning the ITU-T liaison :

Last Thursday, SG15/Q15 working group agreed to send a liaison to IETF. The=
 liaison statement will be finalized and posted in a couple of days.


Best regards,

C=E9dric Lavenu and Thierry Lys

Hi Samita,

Even after the updates the draft only talks about link-local addresses mapp=
ed to the Bluetooth Device Addresses (which may be random addresses).=20

The updates were about non-link-local addresses that are registered with AR=
O and that cannot be determined from link-layer headers. In the new text th=
e nodes can fully elide address when referring to the latest registered add=
ress, and previously registered addresses can only be partially elided. Ple=
ase see example in the updated draft.

Maybe the approach could apply to other foos, but I haven't checked them in=
 detail enough to really tell.

Best regards,

	Teemu

Thanks Teemu for the headsup on the updates.

Question(without reading the latest draft yet): will the compression update=

eric  6lo (ipv6-over-foo) cases in your opinion ?

Hi all,

We received good offline feedback from Erik Rivard regarding some details i=
n the header compression sections, and the feedback is now addressed in thi=
s -12 version.

The changes remove some ambiguities that might have caused interoperability=
 issues, fix an actual bug in CID-field handling, and improve compression p=
erformance in case 6LN is using multitude of non-link-local addresses with =
random IIDs. The multiple addresses for a compression context-case was not =
that well handled in previous draft versions.=20

We don't think the changes are big enough to warrant returning of the docum=
ent to the WG process, but please have a check anyway in case you disagree =
with that assessment.

Best regards,

Teemu

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)
--6EQU1Rxo8gsbQnp8DnLGnRnnoBX4X2957
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

All,
     I have completed my AD evaluation of draft-ietf-6lo-btle as a part
of the publication process.  I have a few points to discuss with the
group before moving this document to IETF Last Call.

* Does the IETF have open access to the IPSP?

* Section 2.1

- Figure 1 shows several fields (Direct Test Mode & Security Manager)
that do not have any descriptive text included in the section.  A brief
mention of their use would be helpful.

- I had to wait until section 3.1 to figure out how IPv6 fit into the
protocol stack illustrated in Figure 1.  A forward pointer to 3.1 or a
brief mention of how IPv6 fits into the stack would be good.

* Section 2.2 : Please clarify that the hub and spoke model does not
preclude 2 peripherals from communicating. The sentence discussing
direct communication made me think momentarily that two peripherals
couldn't communicate.

* Section 3 : Related to the previous comment, the 2nd paragraph
precludes "multihop networks at the link layer".  I would clarify that
inter-peripheral communication is handled by the 6LBR routing function.

* Section 3.1 : It is unclear, to me, on how the IPSS/GATT/ATT blocks in
Figure 3 are supposed to be interpreted. Is IPv6 a GATT? 6LoWPAN an ATT?

* Section 3.2

- Please use a 2119 MUST for header compression.

- Can some clarifying text be added explaining why lengths and addresses
are being inferred?  Or is "inferred" the wrong term here?

- The *brief* discussion of the "multilink model" is too brief.
Something more is needed.  Is this the same multi-link model discussed
in RFC 4903?  If so, how is this case different.

* Section 3.2.1 : Please make an explicit statement on DAD.

* Section 3.2.4 : s/master/Central/

* I think it would be useful if the document contained a summary table
of what 6LoWPAN features are used or not used.  I am not requiring you
add one, but I would like you to consider it.

Regards,
Brian

Hi Teemu,
     I snipped all the points where we have agreement on the action...

I added an IESG note within the datatracker so that reviewers can find
the URL.  Any reason the URL can't be put into the reference?

I think the above would help.  I would also think that adding a
variation of your brief synopsis above to 3.1 could help.

I think adding a forward pointer to 3.3 will help.  I also think that
referencing 4903 and saying why this draft contradicts it would be
useful.  That will preclude future readers from saying "what about RFC
4903?"

Disregard.  I missed the "Effectively" sentence while reviewing.

I am not aware of one, but let me ask a clarifying question.  Is it just
the fragmentation support from 4944 that is not used in this spec?

Regards,
Brian

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Hi,

BTLE is a good tech, but it is not backwards compatible - a BTLE smart 
object does not talk to a BT smartphone - you have to buy a new 
smartphone because of the BTLE devices.

So I wonder whether mandatory HC in IP/BTLE does not introduce 
compatibility problems to IP (HC is optional in IP/BT)?

As an end user, I would have appreciated if BTLE were compatible with BT 
in first place.

If BTLE were rendered compatible with BT in the near future - will 
mandatory HC of this RFC break IP?  Or will this RFC survive unmodified 
when BTLE is made compatible to BT?

(to understand this questioning compare this retro-compatibility issue 
to 802.11b, g, n, ac).

Yours,

Alex

The following errata report has been submitted for RFC4944,
"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks".

--------------------------------------
You may review the report below and at:
http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=3D4944&eid=3D4359

--------------------------------------
Type: Technical
Reported by: Gabriel Montenegro <gabriel.montenegro@microsoft.com>

Section: 5.1

Original Text
-------------
   ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for
      the Dispatch value.  It allows support for Dispatch values larger
      than 127.

Corrected Text
--------------
   ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for
      the Dispatch value.  It allows support for Dispatch values larger
      than 63.

Notes
-----
The (non-ESCaped) Dispatch value is a 6-bit selector. However, it used
to be a 7-bit selector, which has a value at most 127. When the field
became a 6-bit selector, this maximum became 63, but the referring text
was never updated.

For historical reference, see an early version from IETF 67 proposing
the Dispatch value within the Dispatch header as a 7-bit field:

http://6lowpan.tzi.org/FrontPage?action=3DAttachFile&do=3Dview&target=3Dt=
entative-draft2-ietf-6lowpan-format-07.txt

   The dispatch type is defined by a zero-bit as the first bit.  The
   dispatch type and header is shown here:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0|  Dispatch   |  type-specific header
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Dispatch               7-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                          immediately following the Dispatch type.

The relevant slides also show this (slide 8):

Actually, the dispatch field is the first byte of the IEEE 802.15.4 payload.
There are various allocations for this first byte, see Figure 2 of RFC 4944:

           Pattern    Header Type
         +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
         | 00  xxxxxx | NALP       - Not a LoWPAN frame               |

         | 01  111110 | reserved   - Reserved for future use          |
         | 01  111111 | ESC        - Additional Dispatch byte follows |
         | 10  xxxxxx | MESH       - Mesh Header                      |
         | 11  000xxx | FRAG1      - Fragmentation Header (first)     |
         | 11  001000 | reserved   - Reserved for future use          |

         +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 2: Dispatch Value Bit Pattern

There are a number of slightly strange phrasings in RFC 4944 where
allocations of the dispatch field are described and the term "dispatch"
is then used for the variable part of the range (as that part is the
"dispatch" value within that range).

So, for me the errata is that the text talks about extending the range
of (8-bit) dispatch values (which ESC is not about), instead of saying
that ESC together with the next byte opens up a completely new dispatch
space.

This Erratum is about clarifying that the specific mistake in section 5.1
where the number 127 appears when the original intent seems clearly to have
been 63 as shown by the revision history during the development of the
draft, i.e. that it is meant to be talking about the 6-bit type selector
field in the Dispatch value.

I agree that RFC 4944 and RFC 6282 have a lot of confusing language
regarding the semantics of the ESC Dispatch code, but I don't see how to
address those problems in an Erratum. Presumably, those things will be
cleared up when we have an RFC that actually defines how the code reserved
in RFC 6282 for the purpose will actually be used.

I agree with Carsten; this section can be puzzling so I think more
discussion is
warranted before marking as Verified.

First, we should note that the assignment of 01 111111 for ESC has been
deprecated
(but is still referenced) by RFC 6282 and should not be used for that
purpose in new
implementations.

Second, it is not clear whether the replacement text should say "larger
than 63" or
"larger than 255".  RFC 4944, section 5.1 seems to alternately describe
Dispatch
Value as a six bit or eight bit field (cf Figure 2).

Lastly, the sentence under consideration may have propagated to other 6lo
proposals.
I know it's in 6LoBAC.

> 127 should have been 63.

There are 256 dispatch byte values.
Not 127, 63, 128, or 64.

(Adding the ESC construct, there are 511.)

I agree with Gabriel. The original intent of the authors of RFC 4944 at the
time was for this to read 63 not 127, and it is an error worth noting with
an erratum.

I also agree with others who say that the term "dispatch value" is
confusing in RFC 4944 and it isn't clarified satisfactorily in any of the
updates. I would support the working group choosing to develop an update
that clarifies this terminology.

That's a possibility. It's the case that RFC 6282 takes away the ESC
construct and replaces it with a reserved code for us to define how many
additional codes are available. Yes, 511 is an option. There are others
available.

I hope we can have that discussion apart from the question of whether this
very specific and particular error in RFC 4944 can be officially
recognized. I hope we don't block the publication of an erratum because we
can't agree on what the correct text should be now, apart from what we
meant at the time.

(Or is a "Dispatch Value Bit Pattern" different from a "Dispatch type field
value"?)

If the errata was clarifying, I could support it.  My position is that we
should either fix the
whole section or leave it alone.

   ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for
      the Dispatch value.  It allows support for extended Dispatch value
      bit patterns.

I appreciate that your position is we should either A) provide a complete
fix for the confusing text in RFC 4944 by issuing an update, or B) not make
any corrections whatsoever.

I certainly believe we should do option A in addition to verifying the
proposed erratum. I don't see why both cannot be done. Perhaps you could
explain why you take such an inflexible position. It's not clear to me what
damage would be done by us quickly issuing an erratum, intended to correct
the error noted in the current report that the number 127 should have been
changed to 63 when the width of the corresponding dispatch type selector
field was reduced in size from seven bits to six, followed by a more
extended discussion about how to provide the complete fix for clarifying
the terminology around the Dispatch value and its type selector field, as
well as defining how the ESC code is to be used.

I believe the Erratum under discussion is correct and should be marked as
Verified.

The original intent of "Dispatch value" was:
1) To refer to the Dispatch field in the Dispatch Header - note the
capitalization in "Allows support for Dispatch values larger than 127."
2) To identify a namespace that *excludes* the Mesh Addressing and
Fragmentation headers.

The original draft text (draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-07) was less ambiguous
about the original intent.  Referring to that draft:

1) The draft separated the concept of "Header Type" from "Dispatch Value".
The draft defined Header Types: Dispatch, Mesh Delivery, and Fragmentation,
and Dispatch Values: NALP, IPv6, LOWPAN_HC1, LOWPAN_BC0, and ESC.  The
draft also includes the following text that indicates the Mesh Addressing
and Fragmentation headers are not included in the dispatch value namespace:

   The definition of headers, other than mesh addressing and
   fragmentation, in LoWPAN consists of the dispatch value, the
   definition of the header fields that follow

Note that the text above still lives in RFC 4944.

2) The bit pattern figure was titled "Dispatch Type Bit Pattern", not
"Dispatch Value Bit Pattern", with the intent that the table only included
the initial allocations within the Dispatch Header and did *not* include
any mention of Mesh Delivery and Fragmentation headers.

It is true that the RFC is not internally consistent here -- some
counterexamples to the ones you give here are Figure 2 and the text
   NALP:  Specifies that the following bits are not a part of the LoWPAN
      encapsulation, and any LoWPAN node that encounters a dispatch
      value of 00xxxxxx shall discard the packet

Nor is it consistent with the actual usage of the term "dispatch value"
in the literature, as can be seen e.g. in
http://solomon.ipv6.club.tw/Course/ProtocolEngineering/archrock-6lowpan-tutorial.pdf
or the 6LoWPAN book.

Also, there is no mandate that ESC-based dispatch values can only be
used for things other than mesh addressing and fragmentation.  There is
also no intention that the values 0 to 63 following ESC have the same
meaning as the dispatch values 01 000000 to 01 111111.

Expanding the confusing use of the term "dispatch value" just for the
six-bit field in 01 xxxxxx would be wrong.

Grüße, Carsten

Unfortunately, the RFC also does not carry forward the original intent of
the value "127".  All of the counterexamples you gave appear in the RFC (or
as a result of the RFC) and not in draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-07.

Also, there is no mandate that ESC-based dispatch values can only be

You are correct that the intent was not to preclude things that have to do
with mesh addressing and fragmentation.  But I can say that the intent was
the "Mesh Addressing Type and Header" and "Fragmentation Type and Header"
were not included in the "Dispatch Type and Header".  As mentioned
previously, the original version of Figure 2 did not include the Mesh
Addressing and Fragmentation header bit patterns.  To Kerry's point, the
original table included 128 entries, *not* 256 entries.

If you look at draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-07, the term "dispatch value" was
only used in reference to the Dispatch Type and Header.  The update to
draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-08 is where the confusing use of "dispatch value"
started to appear.  draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-07 actually used the 7-bit
dispatch value of 0 to support NALP.  However, there was concern about
consuming too many bits for NALP.  So in draft-ietf-6lowpan-format-08, we
updated NALP to only take one additional bit.  That lead to having 00xxxxxx
for NALP and 01xxxxxx for Dispatch.  Unfortunately, the edits that were
made were quick and dirty.  In retrospect, we should have create a fourth
"Type and Header" for NALP, in addition to Dispatch, Mesh Addressing, and
Fragmentation.  Doing so would have removed any discussion of NALP from the
"Dispatch Type and Header" section as well as the "Bit Pattern" table.

But putting aside the discussion on the original intent of the value "127"
and taking a step back, the high-level intent was to support
arbitrary-length bit patterns for identifying 6LoWPAN headers.  It may be
that removing any reference to a maximum "dispatch value" offered within
the first 8 bits is the best path forward, as Kerry has suggested.

I think the text is almost right, however I think "larger than 63" is no
longer appropriate due to the initial 0b01 bit combination. "larger than
127" worked as it implied the most significant bit could be 1. If the
original intent is to be preserved, the following text would make more
sense to me:

ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for the
Dispatch value.  It allows support for more than 64 Dispatch values.

Alternatively, Kerry's more relaxed text would also work.
