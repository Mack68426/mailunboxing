Thank you for the praise. As it is the initial version, more discussions an=
d comments are needed to make it better.

Zigbee IP specification was developed to enable IP address for Zigbee appli=
cation, thus the protocol stack are built on IETF's standards, including EA=
P-TLS.=20
As discussed in many working groups, TLS might result in a significant amou=
nt of retransmissions due to unreliable communication capability of the net=
work and device, thus energy will be consumed fast.
I think EAP over DTLS /profiled DTLS could be a good option.

Yes, we should describe more clearly on this mechanism, and maybe this draf=
t is a right place. It would be great if folks in the mailing list make com=
ments and contribution on this technical point.=20

According to my knowledge, IP address can be generated once a device is aut=
henticated to network access, afterwards, other further protocols can use I=
P to communicate.=20
Besides, PANA needs IP as well. The incremental bootstrapping takes advanta=
ge of such IP address generation mechanism, so that PANA can be run without=
 any problem.

For unconstrained environment, I agree with you. But when it comes to const=
rained device and constrained network communication, TLS might not be a goo=
d choice as mentioned before. Certificate is not a good choice either due t=
o the high cost.=20
I would like to say: it is about the choice of credential type for secure c=
hannel setup. The good candidates of credential types are Raw public key, P=
hysical Unclonable Function (PUF).

CoAP-DTLS coincides with my idea.
Yang sounds like at a higher level, but I think EAP is actually the mechani=
sm running behind ^_^

Ana

Dear NETCONF WG,
we hereby issue a WG Last Call for 3 weeks for the drafts below:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-04
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-yang-patch-03

Please review and send your comments to the NETCONF WG mailing list by Febr=
uary 26, 2015 EOB PT.
The related draft-ietf-netconf-yang-library will follow with LC as soon as =
the remaining two issues are solved
(see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-yang-library).
RESTCONF documents are planned to publish as standard track documents.
As RESTCONF is a major protocol we expect a detailed and thorough review wi=
thin NETCONF WG but also by the related WGs before publishing.
Therefore the WGLC is planned for 3 weeks and APP, INT and RTG area ADs wil=
l be informed as well as Core, I2rs, 6lo, and 6tisch WGs are invited to rev=
iew.
Please state explicitly that you have read/reviewed and whether you support=
 the publication.
Please indicate also if you plan to implement or have already implementatio=
n experience with RESTCONF.

Thank you,
Mehmet and Mahesh

There is work going on in the IEEE 802.15.9 task group which specifies
the key management for 802.15.4, or more specifically it will specify
a way to transport existing key management protocols over the
802.15.4 frames. This would allow running for example IKEv2 + EAP over
the 802.15.4 and generate keys for 802.15.4 security and then protect
all messages between the two nodes.

In normal case this would be run even before the IEEE 802.15.4
assocation is done, i.e. immediately after the beacon before doing the
association, and would allow protecting the association process too.

For this uses the IKEv2 + EAP would be most likely quite good, i.e.
the IKEv2 frames would be exchange between the peer joining the
network and its next hop router, and inside those IKEv2 frames there
would be EAP messages, which are then relayed to the AAA server (trust
center TC in draft-he-iot-security-bootstrapping-00) for actual
authentication.

The 802.15.9 is now in letter ballot phase in IEEE, meaning we should
be finished quite soon. One issue there is that, during the 802.15.9
work we noticed some issues with 802.15.4 base specifciation which
have been worked on in the 802.15.4 maintenance revision process, and
we need to wait for it to finish before 802.15.9 can finish...

Most likely both of those will finish before the end of year.

Yes, but 802.1X is not enough on its own. It only provides
authentication, not key management. We currently have two 802.1X
versions, i.e. 802.1X/MKA and 802.1X/KEY, but there is going to be
some rewriting happening on those sections. In addition to those we
have IKEv2, HIP, PANA and Dragonfly.

Although JITSI creates a shared etherpad, it's not clear what it actually is,
so it's hard to tell others about it.

So, let's explicitely use this for note taking:
  http://etherpad.tools.ietf.org:9000/p/Roll20150210VirtualInterim?useMonospaceFont=true


If JITSI should fail, instructions on connecting to a backup will be placed
there.

Hello All:


We did not receive any objection on this document during LC call. The co-au=
thors received comments from Carsten  and others prior to the LC call and a=
ddressed accordingly.  The chairs assume that there is no objections from t=
he working group on the technical content change that defines IPSP for 6lo-=
btle.

With that we assume that the LC is now complete for the document.

However, the chairs will do one more review before IESG submissions.


Teemu points us to a  relevant implementation :

Hello 6loWG:


As you know that Bluetooth SIG specification work associated with the follo=
wing draft had been completed. The reference can be found at http://www.iet=
f.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/msg00851.html.  Following the Bluetooth =
specification update on Internet Protocol Support Profile, the following dr=
aft has been updated a few times by the co-authors and reviewed by the docu=
ment shepherd, Carsten Boremann,

The document was previously in IESG review but now it will go through the W=
GLC  and IESG review again due to the relevant changes.

Please review the  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-btle-07  docum=
ent and provide your comments to the 6lo list by Feb 6, 2014.

Thank you.

-Samita

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Abstract:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy=
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetoot=
h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Interest Group.&nbsp; The standard Bluetooth radio has=
 been widely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers=
, audio<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; headsets and many other devices.&nbsp; The low power version o=
f Bluetooth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a specification that enables the use of this air interface =
with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.&nbsp; =
The low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision =
4.0 of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is=
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required for IPv6.&nbsp; This document describes how IPv6 is t=
ransported<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.<br>

Subject: WG Adoption call for draft-hong-6lo-ipv6-over-nfc-03

Hello 6lo WG:

NFC technology has been widely implemented and used in many different devic=
es and laptops and smart phones.
The co-authors of the 6lo-ipv6-over-nfc has been presented at IETF 90 and I=
ETF91 6lo meetings and updated the documents from WG comments.
>From the WG meetings, the members expressed interests in working on this do=
cument.

With the chair-hat on, I  believe this document requires more work  to move=
 forward, if adopted as a WG document.

As per request of the co-authors of the following document, the 6lo-chairs =
like to request adoption for the following work:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hong-6lo-ipv6-over-nfc-03


Please note, the adoption call ends at Feb 6, 2014.

Thanks,
-Samita

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Hello All:


We did not receive any objection on this document during LC call. The co-au=
thors received comments from Carsten  and others prior to the LC call and a=
ddressed accordingly.  The chairs assume that there is no objections from t=
he working group on the technical content change that defines IPSP for 6lo-=
btle.

With that we assume that the LC is now complete for the document.

However, the chairs will do one more review before IESG submissions.


Teemu points us to a  relevant implementation :

Hello 6loWG:


As you know that Bluetooth SIG specification work associated with the follo=
wing draft had been completed. The reference can be found at http://www.iet=
f.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/msg00851.html.  Following the Bluetooth =
specification update on Internet Protocol Support Profile, the following dr=
aft has been updated a few times by the co-authors and reviewed by the docu=
ment shepherd, Carsten Boremann,

The document was previously in IESG review but now it will go through the W=
GLC  and IESG review again due to the relevant changes.

Please review the  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-btle-07  docum=
ent and provide your comments to the 6lo list by Feb 6, 2014.

Thank you.

-Samita

Abstract:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy=
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetoot=
h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Interest Group.&nbsp; The standard Bluetooth radio has=
 been widely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers=
, audio<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; headsets and many other devices.&nbsp; The low power version o=
f Bluetooth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a specification that enables the use of this air interface =
with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.&nbsp; =
The low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision =
4.0 of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is=
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required for IPv6.&nbsp; This document describes how IPv6 is t=
ransported<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.<br>

Dear All,

this is a friendly reminder on the WGLC of the Restconf and YANG-Patch draf=
ts.

As RESTCONF is a major protocol we expect a detailed and thorough review wi=
thin NETCONF WG but also by the related WGs before publishing.

Please review and send your comments to the NETCONF WG mailing list by Febr=
uary 26, 2015 EOB PT.

Many Thanks!

Cheers,
Mehmet

Dear NETCONF WG,

we hereby issue a WG Last Call for 3 weeks for the drafts below:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-04
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-yang-patch-03

Please review and send your comments to the NETCONF WG mailing list by Febr=
uary 26, 2015 EOB PT.
The related draft-ietf-netconf-yang-library will follow with LC as soon as =
the remaining two issues are solved
(see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-yang-library).

RESTCONF documents are planned to publish as standard track documents.
As RESTCONF is a major protocol we expect a detailed and thorough review wi=
thin NETCONF WG but also by the related WGs before publishing.
Therefore the WGLC is planned for 3 weeks and APP, INT and RTG area ADs wil=
l be informed as well as Core, I2rs, 6lo, and 6tisch WGs are invited to rev=
iew.

Please state explicitly that you have read/reviewed and whether you support=
 the publication.
Please indicate also if you plan to implement or have already implementatio=
n experience with RESTCONF.

Thank you,
Mehmet and Mahesh

1) There seems to be a contradiction between section 3.2 and 3.2.1.

Section 3.2.1 says:
> After Bluetooth LE logical link has been established, it
> is referenced with a Connection Handle in HCI.  Thus possibly
> changing device addresses do not impact data flows within existing
> L2CAP channel.  Hence there is no need to change IPv6 link-local
> addresses even if devices change their random device addresses during
> L2CAP channel lifetime

If a device changes its device address but not its link-local address,
then the latter cannot be inferred from the former.  Section 3.2
explains:
> It is assumed that the IPv6
> payload length can be inferred from the L2CAP header length and the
> IID value inferred from the link-layer address with help of Neighbor
> Cache, if elided from compressed packet header.

But it seems that the latter assumption is invalid due to the text
quoted in section 3.2.1.  Assuming the scheme works as 3.2.1 describes,
it seems that the text in section 3.2 is wrong... it's inferred
from the link-layer address and/or Connection Handle, no?

Furthermore, I'd recommend changing "IID value inferred from the
link-layer address" to "IPv6 address inferred from the link-layer
address and context if any".

2)
Section 3.2.1 says:
> For non-link-local addresses a 64-bit IID MAY be formed by utilizing
> the 48-bit Bluetooth device address.  Alternatively, a randomly
> generated IID (see Section 3.2.2) can be used instead, for example,
> as discussed in [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].  The non-link-local
> addresses 6LN generates must be registered with 6LBR as described in
> Section 3.2.2.

The above text is bad in that it implies there are only two alternatives:
device-address-based and random.  This is harmful since, as worded,
it precludes the use of other schemes (DHCPv6, CGAs, HBAs, etc.)
that are not "random" per se.  It needs to be reworded to be clear
that any alternative scheme can be used.

Similarly section 6 (Security Considerations) says:
> For non-link local
> addresses implementations have a choice to support
> [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].

But that's not the only security-relevant addressing scheme.
It should reference RFC 3972, RFC 4941, and RFC 5535 as other examples.

3)
Section 3.2.3 says:
> The Bluetooth LE's star topology structure and ARO can be exploited
> in order to provide a mechanism for IID compression.

Since RFC 6282 allows for eliding the full address in some cases,
RFC 6282 is not just about "IID compression". As such, it would be
more correct to say "address compression" rather than "IID compression".

Thanks Dave for your comments on the btle draft.

We will  wait to  hear from the co-authors  if the editorial suggestions re=
garding the IID related changes are possible in the context of BT-LE specif=
ications.

Subject: [6lo] Comments on draft-ietf-6lo-btle-08

1) There seems to be a contradiction between section 3.2 and 3.2.1.

Section 3.2.1 says:
> After Bluetooth LE logical link has been established, it
> is referenced with a Connection Handle in HCI.  Thus possibly
> changing device addresses do not impact data flows within existing
> L2CAP channel.  Hence there is no need to change IPv6 link-local
> addresses even if devices change their random device addresses during
> L2CAP channel lifetime

If a device changes its device address but not its link-local address,
then the latter cannot be inferred from the former.  Section 3.2
explains:
> It is assumed that the IPv6
> payload length can be inferred from the L2CAP header length and the
> IID value inferred from the link-layer address with help of Neighbor
> Cache, if elided from compressed packet header.

But it seems that the latter assumption is invalid due to the text
quoted in section 3.2.1.  Assuming the scheme works as 3.2.1 describes,
it seems that the text in section 3.2 is wrong... it's inferred
from the link-layer address and/or Connection Handle, no?

Furthermore, I'd recommend changing "IID value inferred from the
link-layer address" to "IPv6 address inferred from the link-layer
address and context if any".

2)
Section 3.2.1 says:
> For non-link-local addresses a 64-bit IID MAY be formed by utilizing
> the 48-bit Bluetooth device address.  Alternatively, a randomly
> generated IID (see Section 3.2.2) can be used instead, for example,
> as discussed in [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].  The non-link-local
> addresses 6LN generates must be registered with 6LBR as described in
> Section 3.2.2.

The above text is bad in that it implies there are only two alternatives:
device-address-based and random.  This is harmful since, as worded,
it precludes the use of other schemes (DHCPv6, CGAs, HBAs, etc.)
that are not "random" per se.  It needs to be reworded to be clear
that any alternative scheme can be used.

Similarly section 6 (Security Considerations) says:
> For non-link local
> addresses implementations have a choice to support
> [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].

But that's not the only security-relevant addressing scheme.
It should reference RFC 3972, RFC 4941, and RFC 5535 as other examples.

3)
Section 3.2.3 says:
> The Bluetooth LE's star topology structure and ARO can be exploited
> in order to provide a mechanism for IID compression.

Since RFC 6282 allows for eliding the full address in some cases,
RFC 6282 is not just about "IID compression". As such, it would be
more correct to say "address compression" rather than "IID compression".

Please find the new version of Diet-ESP a compress IPsec/ESP for IoT. We
have implemented and tested Diet-ESP. Compared to the standard IPsec/ESP,
Diet-ESP can reduce the networking overhead added to unprotected data from
100% to a few percent. I will be happy to present these draft next IETF.

Feel free to make comments!

The drafts includes:
    1) draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp-requirements
<http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp-requirements/>:
lists the requirements for Diet-ESP
    2) draft-mglt-6lo-aes-implicit-iv
<http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mglt-6lo-aes-implicit-iv/>:
indicates how to avoid carrying the IV in each ESP packet. It is instead
generated by each peers. The protocols described in the draft can be used
with the regular IPsec/ESP.
    3) draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp
<http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp/> describes the
core Diet-ESP protocol, that is how to compress/decompress each fields of
the standard IPsec/ESP. Compression is discribed through a Diet-ESP Context.
    4) draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp-payload-compression
<http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp-payload-compression/>:
describes how the clear text can be compressed before encryption. In fact
unless IPsec/ESP is used with NULL encryption, the data in the ESP packet
is encrypted. Encryption makes compression hard to perform. Instead
compressing before encrypting can be very efficient. This makes possible to
remove UDP/TPC/IP tunnel headers.
    5) draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp-context-ikev2-extension
<http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mglt-6lo-diet-esp-context-ikev2-extension/>:
describes how to negociate Diet-ESP with IKEv2. In fact this mostly result
in an agreement for the DIet-ESP Context. This exchange may then be
extended to Diet-HIP Exchange.

Daniel

Hi Scott,

Thank you for the feed back. I agree that compressing the ICV reduces
security related to authentication. Let's call this a "weak
authentication".

I am not saying it is a valid argument, but since IPsec enables NULL
authentication too, we considered that enabling "weak authentication" would
be possible with a clear warning in the security consideration.

The reason we are looking we are looking for weak authentication is to be
able to balance authentication with bandwidth optimization. In fact,
suppose you compute the mean/median over a thousand different value, that
one or two values are corrupted may not have much impact overall, and we
may prefer to extend the life time of the mote for 5 years instead.

Regarding you comment I think the issue ou raised is more related to GCM.
-- By the way I would be interested to have a description or relevant doc
describing  why ICV in GCM particularly matters. One way to address the
issue you raised would be:
    - 1) mention the need for weak authentication in the requirement draft
    - 2) remove ICV compression from Diet-ESP
    - 3) Define encryption protocols with weak authentication with
different sizes of the ICV. For example suppose AES-MODEX has an ICV of N,
then we may need to add AES-MODEX_i with i in [0 ... N-1].

The advantage of doing so is that it avoids end user to weaken the
protocols especially when one compression is fine with one protocol but not
with the others. In that sense it looks a better design.

However, I see the following drawbacks:
    - It requires to create multiple encryption protocols. Unlike
compression, implementation cannot use existing implementation of AES-MODEX=
.
    - Negociation for hosts accepting all AES-MODEX_i with i in [0 ... N-1]
requires many SA payload in the IKEv2 negotiation. However, we may deal
with this with a AES-MODEX_ALL to indicate the responder choses its
compression.

BR,
Daniel

Hi,

Do you have any opinion on the proposed alternative?

    - 1) mention the need for weak authentication in the requirement draft
    - 2) remove ICV compression from Diet-ESP
    - 3) Define encryption protocols with "weak authentication" with
different sizes of the ICV. For example suppose AES-MODEX has an ICV of N,
then we may need to add AES-MODEX_i with i in [0 ... N-1].

BR,
Daniel

Daniel,

I understand that you spend a lot of time in writing these
specifications but, as mentioned in the past I just do not see the need
for this type of standardization activity. Nobody I have spoken with
asks for this functionality.

If there is indeed a need for IPsec ESP use in IoT then I am not sure
that the proposed optimizations are so useful given the impact for
security.

Ciao
Hannes

Thank you Dave very much for your comments. Please see inline:

>> It is assumed that the IPv6

>> IID value inferred from the link-layer address with help of Neighbor
>> Cache, if elided from compressed packet header.
>But it seems that the latter assumption is invalid due to the text
>quoted in section 3.2.1.=A0 Assuming the scheme works as 3.2.1 describes,

Inferred once from the device address at the time of connection establishme=
nt, and from there on from the connection handle. Will clarify this.

>Furthermore, I'd recommend changing "IID value inferred from the
>link-layer address" to "IPv6 address inferred from the link-layer
>address and context if any".

Ok.

Ok, I see what you mean. When writing, the *intent* of "random" was to indi=
cate everything else but device address.. Will reword.

>Similarly section 6 (Security Considerations) says:
>> For non-link local
>> addresses implementations have a choice to support
>> [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].
>But that's not the only security-relevant addressing scheme.
>It should reference RFC 3972, RFC 4941, and RFC 5535 as other examples.

The section 3.2.1 says:" can be used instead, for example, as discussed in =
[I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids]. ". The idea was to try to avoid listing vario=
us RFCs that define addressing schemes.. but we can add the examples to fur=
ther clarify that the intent is not to limit.

>> The Bluetooth LE's star topology structure and ARO can be exploited

>Since RFC 6282 allows for eliding the full address in some cases,

True.

We'll try to get -09 out tomorrow, or by Friday latest, which addresses the=
se comments.

Hi Scott,

Thanks for the feed back, this is clearly some text that needs to be added
to draft. So options to deal with the compression of the ICV are:
    - a) Allowing ICV compression with some restrictions like the ones you
mention.
    - b) Not allowing ICV compression and explicitly listing encryption
algorithms with small ICV

BR,
Daniel

Hi Hannes,

We designing Diet-ESP was to enable motes to secure their communications
and provide end-to-end security. This function is important for us and I
guess we are not the only one interested in this functionality.

We believe it is worth exposing how IPsec can be use to fit the IoT
constraints, regardless of what other protocols are providing.

There are probably other alternatives (like DTLS), however :
    - a) DTLS/IPsec address different use cases
    - b) no real comparison have been made possible between these security
protocols designed for IoT, and we believe IPsec is pretty efficient.

Current spec may not be perfect. However, the impact on security can
largely be under control. First of all Diet-ESP results in the combination
of ROHC ROHCoverIPsec which are already standard with deep security
reviews. Then most of the compressed fields are not security related.
Padding, Pad Len, Next Header have nothing to deal with security.

Security related fields are SN, ICV, SPI. SN and SPI are compressed means
that they have to be decompressed before applying IPsec/ESP. Because of the
compression/decompression these fields are not altered and from an
IPsec/ESP perspective compression is transparent. On the other hand,
appropriate values MUST be chosen so compression/decompression can occur.

In the case of the ICV, this value cannot be decompressed, and thus we have
to make things right. Two alternatives are proposed and I would be happy to
update the draft with the best one.

If you have specific security impacts in mind, please let us know.

BR,
Daniel

Hi Paul,

The bare minimal implementation of IKEv2 and IPsec/ESP have been proposed
in lwig WG: draft-ietf-lwig-ikev2-minimal-01.txt
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lwig-ikev2-minimal-01> and
draft-mglt-lwig-minimal-esp-01.txt
<http://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mglt-lwig-minimal-esp-01.txt>

Diet-ESP is definitely not "tweaking a byte here and there". Instead, it
combines ROHC ROHCoverIPsec and IPsec/ESP. This provides the necessary
flexibility to provide the appropriated security in any situation.

I appreciate you provide feed back, however, I need more technical argument
to make you less nervous.

BR,
Daniel

BR,
Daniel

Hi Paul,

I click send too quickly. I agree that providing the minimal description
for ESP and IKEv2 is useful, however Diet-ESP and minimal implementations
have different goals.

BR,
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

I would like to understand your use case a bit better. Just securing
sensor communication is not enough.

What application layer protocols do you expect to run on these devices?
What radio technologies do you assume are going to be used?
How does the envisioned stack on these devices look like?

Ciao
Hannes

Hello All:


We have requested 2-hr 6lo WG session slot at Dallas in March.

Now is the time to call for the agenda items for the WG session.

Please send your requests to the co-chairs and James and include the follow=
ing information:


*         Name and link of your draft

*         A brief description of  your presentation topic

*         Approximate time (I,e 10min or 15min )


We are going to evaluate the requests based on WG items, charters, WG inter=
ests and issues that require face-to-face resolution and allocate time as t=
hey fit in the 2hr time slot.

Thanks,
-Samita

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Thanks Dave for your comments on the btle draft.

We will  wait to  hear from the co-authors  if the editorial suggestions re=
garding the IID related changes are possible in the context of BT-LE specif=
ications.

Subject: [6lo] Comments on draft-ietf-6lo-btle-08

1) There seems to be a contradiction between section 3.2 and 3.2.1.

Section 3.2.1 says:
> After Bluetooth LE logical link has been established, it
> is referenced with a Connection Handle in HCI.  Thus possibly
> changing device addresses do not impact data flows within existing
> L2CAP channel.  Hence there is no need to change IPv6 link-local
> addresses even if devices change their random device addresses during
> L2CAP channel lifetime

If a device changes its device address but not its link-local address,
then the latter cannot be inferred from the former.  Section 3.2
explains:
> It is assumed that the IPv6
> payload length can be inferred from the L2CAP header length and the
> IID value inferred from the link-layer address with help of Neighbor
> Cache, if elided from compressed packet header.

But it seems that the latter assumption is invalid due to the text
quoted in section 3.2.1.  Assuming the scheme works as 3.2.1 describes,
it seems that the text in section 3.2 is wrong... it's inferred
from the link-layer address and/or Connection Handle, no?

Furthermore, I'd recommend changing "IID value inferred from the
link-layer address" to "IPv6 address inferred from the link-layer
address and context if any".

2)
Section 3.2.1 says:
> For non-link-local addresses a 64-bit IID MAY be formed by utilizing
> the 48-bit Bluetooth device address.  Alternatively, a randomly
> generated IID (see Section 3.2.2) can be used instead, for example,
> as discussed in [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].  The non-link-local
> addresses 6LN generates must be registered with 6LBR as described in
> Section 3.2.2.

The above text is bad in that it implies there are only two alternatives:
device-address-based and random.  This is harmful since, as worded,
it precludes the use of other schemes (DHCPv6, CGAs, HBAs, etc.)
that are not "random" per se.  It needs to be reworded to be clear
that any alternative scheme can be used.

Similarly section 6 (Security Considerations) says:
> For non-link local
> addresses implementations have a choice to support
> [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].

But that's not the only security-relevant addressing scheme.
It should reference RFC 3972, RFC 4941, and RFC 5535 as other examples.

3)
Section 3.2.3 says:
> The Bluetooth LE's star topology structure and ARO can be exploited
> in order to provide a mechanism for IID compression.

Since RFC 6282 allows for eliding the full address in some cases,
RFC 6282 is not just about "IID compression". As such, it would be
more correct to say "address compression" rather than "IID compression".

Hi BT-LE folks,

As we start thinking about pushing this draft over to the IESG, one questio=
n that needs resolution is the status of IPR.

In particular, questions 7 and 8 in the document write-up need to address t=
his:
http://www.ietf.org/iesg/template/doc-writeup-qa-style.html

"(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures=
 required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 hav=
e already been filed. If not, explain why?"

I see there is no IPR disclosure, which may be ok, but please *each* one of=
 you acknowledge that it is or otherwise explain the situation.

Thanks,

6lo Chairs

Hi,

This document went to IESG "Publication Requested" first time at 2012-05-15=
. At that time we went through this same question with exactly the same set=
 of authors, and the result is documented here https://datatracker.ietf.org=
/doc/draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle/history/ (at date 2012-05-15):
--
(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR
disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78
and BCP 79 have already been filed. If not, explain why.

Yes, this has been re-confirmed by each individual author on
2012-05-13/-14.
--
Naturally I can't comment on behalf of other authors, but what I know the s=
ituation has not changed since the last time.

The BT SIG's IPSP feature referenced from this draft is covered by BT SIG's=
 policies, as described on page 3 of the IPSP document.

Best regards,

                Teemu

Subject: [6lo] IPR on draft-ietf-6lo-btle?

Hi BT-LE folks,

As we start thinking about pushing this draft over to the IESG, one questio=
n that needs resolution is the status of IPR.

In particular, questions 7 and 8 in the document write-up need to address t=
his:
http://www.ietf.org/iesg/template/doc-writeup-qa-style.html

"(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures=
 required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 hav=
e already been filed. If not, explain why?"

I see there is no IPR disclosure, which may be ok, but please *each* one of=
 you acknowledge that it is or otherwise explain the situation.

Thanks,

6lo Chairs

Hi Danping,

I have some general comments on the draft and some additional comments=20
inline, bracketed by <RCC></RCC>

General comments:

I think the general model is good but could be simplified to two cases:

1) Where the authenticator is in direct communication
2) Where the authenticator is not in direct communication (relay case)

My reasoning is because:

a) There isn't much distinction between RFD and FFD from an=20
authentication perspective
b) There isn't much distinction between joining an existing network and=20
initial joining

If you think there are distinctions, then they need clarifying.

Other points:

  * "Because IEEE 802.15.4 maximum payload size is 128 Bytes, a standard
    security bootstrapping protocol should be light-weight with low
    complexity.": I think it would be better to say "should ideally be
    light-weight with low complexity". There may be requirements where
    high security strength is required and therefore this will
    necessarily involve more communication overhead and processing.
  * I think the hierarchical joining description is generally useful.
  * It is conceivable for an RFD to communicate directly with a 6LBR so
    I don't think that should be excluded from Figure 1
  * "[I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] proposes a zero-touch
    bootstrapping key infrastructure to allow joining device securely
    and automatically bootstraps itself based on 802.1AR certificate.=20
    It can't be directly used in 802.15.4 devices due to the high
    security complexity and heavy communication overhead.": I disagree
    with this statement. We used this approach in ZigBee IP. I agree
    some may think the communication overhead "heavy" but that doesn't
    mean it can't be done. The associated security complexity is also
    becoming less onerous as crypto accelerators become built into
    hardware and cores.
  * The document mentions a couple of protocols (EAP and PANA) but
    doesn't go into enough detail on how those are deployed. Also, there
    are other choices. The document could give generic names to the
    particular communications and then add a section to give examples.

<RCC>I agree that it has not generally been articulated well. To some=20
extent, it is because up to now, there has been no "the one way to do=20
it". Therefore, something ZigBee IP is a profile which defines one=20
particular way of doing it. There are other ways as well, of course. I=20
guess the question is whether it can be generalised sufficiently to be=20
generally applicable and whether that is in fact worth doing</RCC>

<RCC>I realise that PANA/EAP/EAP-TLS gets roundly criticised for being=20
"heavyweight". Indeed, there are overheads in the use of these three=20
very well-established protocols which could be removed in certain cases. =

However, this would result in the development of new protocols. Having=20

    Hi Danping,<br>
    <br>
    I have some general comments on the draft and some additional
    comments inline, bracketed by &lt;RCC&gt;&lt;/RCC&gt;<br>
    <br>
    General comments:<br>
    <br>
    I think the general model is good but could be simplified to two
    cases:<br>
    <br>
    1) Where the authenticator is in direct communication<br>
    2) Where the authenticator is not in direct communication (relay
    case)<br>
    <br>
    My reasoning is because:<br>
    <br>
    a) There isn't much distinction between RFD and FFD from an
    authentication perspective<br>
    b) There isn't much distinction between joining an existing network
    and initial joining<br>
    <br>
    If you think there are distinctions, then they need clarifying.<br>
    <br>
    Other points:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>"Because IEEE 802.15.4 maximum payload size is 128 Bytes, a
        standard security bootstrapping protocol should be light-weight
        with low complexity.": I think it would be better to say "should
        ideally be light-weight with low complexity". There may be
        requirements where high security strength is required and
        therefore this will necessarily involve more communication
        overhead and processing.<br>
      </li>
      <li>I think the hierarchical joining description is generally
        useful.</li>
      <li>It is conceivable for an RFD to communicate directly with a
        6LBR so I don't think that should be excluded from Figure 1</li>
      <li>"[I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] proposes a
        zero-touch bootstrapping key infrastructure to allow joining
        device securely and automatically bootstraps itself based on
        802.1AR certificate.=A0 It can't be directly used in 802.15.4
        devices due to the high security complexity and heavy
        communication overhead.": I disagree with this statement. We
        used this approach in ZigBee IP. I agree some may think the
        communication overhead "heavy" but that doesn't mean it can't be
        done. The associated security complexity is also becoming less
        onerous as crypto accelerators become built into hardware and
        cores.</li>
      <li>The document mentions a couple of protocols (EAP and PANA) but
        doesn't go into enough detail on how those are deployed. Also,
        there are other choices. The document could give generic names
        to the particular communications and then add a section to give
        examples.</li>
    </ul>

	&gt; I found that you explained the incremental boot-strapping process q=

Thank you for the praise. As it is the initial version, more discussions =

    </blockquote>
    &lt;RCC&gt;I agree that it has not generally been articulated well.
    To some extent, it is because up to now, there has been no "the one
    way to do it". Therefore, something ZigBee IP is a profile which
    defines one particular way of doing it. There are other ways as
    well, of course. I guess the question is whether it can be
    generalised sufficiently to be generally applicable and whether that
    is in fact worth doing&lt;/RCC&gt;<br>

	&gt;=20
	&gt; Given that:
	&gt;=20
	&gt;    Because IEEE 802.15.4 maximum payload size is 128 Bytes, a stand=
ard
	&gt;    security bootstrapping protocol should be light-weight with low
	&gt;    complexity.  The protocol must allow for commissioning of device=
s
	&gt;=20
	&gt; I was surprised that the draft then suggested EAP with PANA as a tr=
ansport:</pre>
    </blockquote>
    &lt;RCC&gt;I realise that PANA/EAP/EAP-TLS gets roundly criticised
    for being "heavyweight". Indeed, there are overheads in the use of
    these three very well-established protocols which could be removed
    in certain cases. However, this would result in the development of
    new protocols. Having done a lot of work in looking at DTLS options,
    I can confidently say that the difference at the end of the day is
    quite small&lt;/RCC&gt;<br>

	&gt;=20
	&gt;    If EAP is used, PANA can be used to relay the authentication mes=
sage
	&gt;    from configured FFDs to 6LBR.  If the validation is successful, =
the
	&gt;    IP address and network key are generated and delivered to the FF=
D.
	&gt;=20
	&gt; But, EAP-TLS with PANA is exactly what the Zigbee IP specification =
has specified.
	&gt; Do you envision any changes from that specification?

Zigbee IP specification was developed to enable IP address for Zigbee app=
lication, thus the protocol stack are built on IETF's standards, includin=
g EAP-TLS.=20
As discussed in many working groups, TLS might result in a significant am=
ount of retransmissions due to unreliable communication capability of the=
 network and device, thus energy will be consumed fast.

Hi Danping,

I would also like to note that
[I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] is only one possible way of
distributing new keys (based on already pre-provisioned certificates). I
would like to understand how it relates to other approaches.
Particularly if you consider an approach "heavy" it would be good to
know what your main concerns are since there is no free lunch with
security and most of the design decisions are trade-offs.

Ciao
Hannes

Hi Gabriel,

I'm personally not aware of any IPR that would be relevant to this draft.

Subject: IPR on draft-ietf-6lo-btle?

Hi BT-LE folks,

As we start thinking about pushing this draft over to the IESG, one questio=
n that needs resolution is the status of IPR.

In particular, questions 7 and 8 in the document write-up need to address t=
his:
http://www.ietf.org/iesg/template/doc-writeup-qa-style.html

"(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures=
 required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 hav=
e already been filed. If not, explain why?"

I see there is no IPR disclosure, which may be ok, but please *each* one of=
 you acknowledge that it is or otherwise explain the situation.

Thanks,

6lo Chairs

Hannes,

I agree that we need to compare different approaches. I do have one
concern in the anima context that leads me to the conclusion that
we *must* pick a preferred solution: if we consider a collection of
multivendor equipment in factory condition that we want to bootstrap
itself into a secure network when we apply power, I don't see how
we can avoid having a single default solution. If not, we get a
rather ludicrous situation where we need a single default solution
to the problem of choosing which bootstrap solution to use.

Regards
   Brian

Hello authors of draft-ietf-6lo-btle and draft-ietf-6lo-dect-ule,

Both of your drafts have problematic normative references to an informative=
 document, namely RFC4541 (IGMP/MLD snooping).

Any document that aspires to become a proposed standard will have an issue =
if it has normative references to an informational document. This is what t=
he IDnits say:

     (See RFCs 3967 and 4897 for information about using normative referenc=
es
     to lower-maturity documents in RFCs)

As you'll see, exceptions to this rule are possible. I'd think that an exce=
ption for this particular document of IGMP/MLD snooping would be harder tha=
n most.

So, I would urge you to reconsider if this needs to be a normative referenc=
e. Making it an informative reference would clear this potential roadblock.

Please take a look at the documents that reference RFC4541: http://datatrac=
ker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4541/referencedby/

You'll notice no *standards track* RFC's have normative references to it. A=
 previous example of an IP-over-foo document that references it is rfc5692<=
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5692/> (I remember it as I was the co-ch=
air for that WG). You might want to look at that example. In particular, yo=
u'll notice that normative language (SHOULD, MAY, MUST, etc) was avoided wh=
en referring to it.

Ralph was the responsible AD for rfc5692 so he might have some more input o=
n this.

Thanks,

Gabriel (with co-chair hat on)

Hi,

This document went to IESG "Publication Requested" first time at 2012-05-15=
. At that time we went through this same question with exactly the same set=
 of authors, and the result is documented here https://datatracker.ietf.org=
/doc/draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle/history/ (at date 2012-05-15):
--
(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR
disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78
and BCP 79 have already been filed. If not, explain why.

Yes, this has been re-confirmed by each individual author on
2012-05-13/-14.
--
Naturally I can't comment on behalf of other authors, but what I know the s=
ituation has not changed since the last time.

The BT SIG's IPSP feature referenced from this draft is covered by BT SIG's=
 policies, as described on page 3 of the IPSP document.

Best regards,

                Teemu

Subject: [6lo] IPR on draft-ietf-6lo-btle?

Hi BT-LE folks,

As we start thinking about pushing this draft over to the IESG, one questio=
n that needs resolution is the status of IPR.

In particular, questions 7 and 8 in the document write-up need to address t=
his:
http://www.ietf.org/iesg/template/doc-writeup-qa-style.html

"(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures=
 required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 hav=
e already been filed. If not, explain why?"

I see there is no IPR disclosure, which may be ok, but please *each* one of=
 you acknowledge that it is or otherwise explain the situation.

Thanks,

6lo Chairs

Some notes on these changes:

NFC doc: call for adoption is now marked as DONE


6lo-rpl-nhc: It is preliminary to say we'll adopt it. We first have to deci=
de what to do with respect to compressing the RPL artifacts (hopefully in D=
allas or latest by summer). This may come back depending on the decision of=
 the way forward.


6775-update: was not approved by Brian, so deleted it from our milestones. =
We'll continue on it until requirements are agreed upon, and those will gui=
de whatever work needs to be done.=20

Thanks,

Gabriel

So there is already ZigBee IP's EAP-TLS approach.
Then, why do you think a new approach is needed?

Thanks for the pointers.

We are currently working on an analysis draft to see if there is
interest in new work in this area.
I think that any solution work should follow on the results of such a
discussion.

What do you think?

Hi Brian,

Just a small annotation to your default approach comment.
Bootstrapping is subject to different installation procedures.
A clear example is the difference between home (plug and play) and the 
building control where bootstrapping is organized from a database.
In the professional domain the order of things can depend on the 
installer. For example, some may want to bootstrap together with the 
setup of the network, others may want the network to be ready and then 
do the security bootstrap.

Although I agree with your concern expressed as "a default procedure to 
decide on the bootstrap procedure", I think there is room for 2-4 
different security bootstrap procedures.
These procedures will be chosen as function of the application domain 
and application owner, installer.

Peter

Peter, Brian,

I would strongly recommend not to use the term bootstrapping. Replacing
it with some other word that explains what you want to do.

After-all, we are engineers and not marketing guys. I tend to get a bit
nervous when I read terms like "zero-touch" and alike that create the
impression that there is no configuration that needs to be done by
anyone. Of course, that's not the case.

With all the security drafts in NETCONF (zerotouch) or in ANIMA I get
the impression that we are re-inventing the wheel not only because we
want to work on new stuff but largely because we actually don't
understand the state of the art ourselves anymore. I fear that the
<draft-he-iot-security-bootstrapping-00> document also falls into the
category of not understanding the state-of-the-art. I understand if
someone is not up-to-speed with the most recent efforts in Thread
(because they are only visible to members of that organization) but the
ZigBee-IP work should be known. While ZigBee-IP may be considered dead
by know it also appears to me that any new work in the IETF on
security/routing/etc. for IEEE 802.15.4 will have to compete against
Thread. Thread has seen a dramatic growth rate in terms of membership
and so I doubt that work in the same area has a lot of chances for
success.

Sorry for the rant but I believe it will help everyone to figure out
that most of the groups are actually developing the same solutions over
and over again.

Now to the issue of the multi-vendor equipment. Adding new solutions (as
it is done in ANIMA) while other groups and organizations have already
standardized similar technologies (using different terminology) will not
make the interoperability any better. I am sure you know that far too wel=
l.

It would be great to have a conversation (maybe at the next IETF
meeting) how the different environments (home environment, enterprise
environments/industrial environments) are different in terms of
provisioning credentials and configuration information to IoT devices.
Needless to say that there are differences and you can see them when you
look at how existing products work. That does, however, not necessarily
mean that there are no common building blocks.

A first draft version of the IETF92 agenda is out.
** THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE ** for conflict resolution,
so please don't make travel arrangements based on it.

Here is my usual eclectic condensed agenda built from that.
There are no ROLL or DICE meetings in the agenda this time.
Again, the Constrained Node/Network group meetings are nicely spread out over the week, with a peak on Wednesday.
I also put in the weekend meeting of the proposed Thing-to-thing Research Group ; I hope to have details for this on Monday.

All times are CDT (UTC-0500) (use https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda-utc and press the button to get your local time in case you want to listen in from remote).

Grüße, Carsten

Hannes,

"Bootstrapping" is a colloquialism, of course, but it conveys the idea
of having no prior knowledge which is the main point here. Of course
it's true (as Peter said) that different situations call for differences
in the solution. The initial target for Anima is "professionally managed
networks" and for that we tend to assume that devices are pre-registered
in some sense; that is a false assumption for homenets and (I assume) IoT.
I am pretty sure that IoT approaches will be a false assumption for
large international carrier networks.

I know nothing about Thread, whatever and whoever it is. If they
want to repeat the Bluetooth error of working in secret, there is
nothing we can do about it, neither can we sit back and do nothing.
At least draft-pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra builds pn
IEEE 802.1AR.

Regards
   Brian

By the way, even if it's ludicrous...

This could be done with GDNP. Notionally, it would look like this

Discover("Enrollment Method"="Any")
 followed by
Response("Enrollment Method"="Thread", Locator=<some IP address>)
 or
Response("Enrollment Method"="RFCxxxx", Locator=<some IP address>)

or whatever.

I would consider this unfortunate because it immediately raises
interoperability issues. But it could be done, if the world ends
up with competing solutions.

Hi Brian, Hannes,

About negotiation of bootstrapping choice:

Standardizing components for the "security bootstrapping" of low 
resource devices, gives a consortium the possibility to agree on a 
selection of building blocks
which is preloaded in the consortium stamped devices,
accompanied by parameter settings.
The parameter setting may further determine the bootstrap actions.
Prefixing parameter settings is a well-known technique. This can be done 
in the factory; Servers can also be used for that matter.

Peter

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

And that is a problem. I mean the word "consortium" is a problem; it
amounts to a cartel and excludes non-consortium members from the market.
That is not what we want in the Internet. We may have to deal with it as
part of reality, but we have to focus on open standards that everybody
can implement. Whether the open standard is based on draft-pritikin or
something else is a separate question, of course.

In the last few days I've had to deal with two vendor-specific wireless
enrollment issues (garage door openers and remote weather sensors) and
I don't think that is a direction we should encourage.

And it's exactly what we want to avoid in autonomic networks.

Sorry but, Hannes, you have been saying these things for some time but
I have not heard your proposal yet. What should we call it if not
bootstrapping?

Yes but what is Thread's solution on this? Is this different than what
we have in IETF?

Exactly. Maybe this is what Peter is pointing at when he says several
solutions can be developed, different for each environment.

The problem with the term is that it is ill-defined.

In many of the cases it actually does not mean that there is no prior
knowledge. For the specifications we are talking about here we are
assuming various information pre-configured, such as certificates, trust
anchors, and other configuration parameters. That's not exactly my
understanding of "no prior knowledge".

Here is an intro document:

The IEEE, the Bluetooth SIG, and Thread have (as organizations) many
things in common. Only member companies can influence the specification
content but, unlike the IEEE, Thread is a fairly new organization and
hence their specifications have not yet been released since they are
still work in progress. Both IEEE and Bluetooth SIG release their
specifications to the general public when they are finalized.

I am not sure I agree that the Bluetooth SIG made huge mistakes since
otherwise the technology wouldn't be so successful.

> IEEE 802.1AR.

To be honest, I am a bit doubtful about the value of the IEEE 802.1AR
specification.

The specification basically says to use certificates and the PKI (using
RSA / ECC-based keys) for authenticating devices and defines a MIB for
configuring various aspects of that infrastructure (using SNMP).

It also lists the fields of a certificate and defines the "device
identity" in Section 7.2.8 as "This may include the unique device serial
number assigned by the manufacturer or any other suitable unique DN
value that the issuer prefers."

I am sure there are some (not described) good reasons why the
specification exists but it is not as earth-shaking as you might think.
Particularly, if you plan to use it in ANIMA you might ask yourself how
many management interfaces you actually need to provision and configure
credentials on devices. (This actually leads us back to my original mail.=
)

I have to think about the use of these specifications for Internet of
Things scenarios I am a bit hesitant to immediately get excited. I
already have other protocols that provide this functionality and much
more functionality (such as a software update mechanism) without the use
of a network management protocol. In general, the specification offers
too many options.

How does all of this relate to the work you are doing in the ANIMA
working group? I do not necessarily have any objections against a new
attempt to solve problems that have already been solved before. There
may be short-comings with the existing solutions. Of course, that
assumes that one has ideas about what should be improved about the
existing solutions.

Ciao
Hannes

I also have been thinking that there can be only one default for a given
piece of vendor equipment.  Though it is conceivable that a vendor may
offer different SKUs to set which default is used.

That said, it seems that the "default mechanism" can actually be a suite
of mechanisms.  I postulate that there can be a safe ordering of
bootstrapping mechanisms, so long as a denial-of-service on an earlier
mechanism doesn't lead to a weaker mechanism.  To this I add that physical
presence (e.g., USB flash drive) is more secure than networking, and that
local networking (link-local) is more secure than WAN networking.  The
question is if using a more secure mechanism actually makes a difference.
For instance, one might think that information loaded from a USB flash
drive could forego needing to be signed, but why do this if the risk it
introduces is non-zero and the signing operation is low-burden?

Thanks,
Kent

I fear that we may have to assume the worst (i.e. there is no universal
solution that all vendors will support).

Sigh: you are probably right. This sounds like a major topic in itself,
so Anima will have to be flexible.

Well in theory yes, but don't forget the Stuxnet propagation mechanism.

I would extend link-local to domain-local (for a professionally managed
network), but otherwise I agree.

Makes sense in a large network where USB drives found in the parking lot
might be considered a risk.

<A>
IMHO, there are distinctions between the network level bootstrapping and jo=
ining device level bootstrapping. Network level bootstrapping includes at l=
east two cases: network start-up case and re-commissioning case. The bootst=
rapping network level bootstrapping request should be different from that o=
f joining device level request in order to converge efficiently. I agree th=
at they need to be clarified.

<A>
 ' can't be directly used' means that fragmentation is needed and certifica=
te management is needed once 802.1AR is applied.

<A>This draft targets at 802.15.4 networks, and one standard approach is po=
ssible. It is worth of generalizing an automatic mechanism for bootstrappin=
g IoT network. As the size of the network can be large, network start-up or=
 re-commission will be the burden of the network administrator.</A>

  >=20

<A>I agree that the handshake process is similar, however DTLS and UDP is s=
upported by CoAP and match the feature of constrained device. Reusing the p=
rotocols can reduce the HW and SW cost. Besides, EAP-TLS only supports cert=
ificate as authentication material, while allowing other materials would be=
 desired for IoT network.</A>

How does a device that has just been switched on know whether it
is joining an existing network or is simply one of many devices that
are attempting to form a new network?

How does a set of devices that are attempting to form a new network
know that they are re-commissioning a previously existing network?

The only safe assumption seem to be that devices cannot know
these things. Autonomic devices have no state at power-on.

I think we need to clarify here that Thread Group is formed to deal
with home environments.

Enterprise or industrial environments seem to be excluded.

Thanks for that. It seems to have all the downsides of secretive ad hoc
membership-based consortia, except for the upside of a RAND-RF IPR
policy.

So far. The boundary between this and larger building services
networks is pretty fuzzy, isn't it?

In any case, should we (the WGs on copy, and perhaps some others)
be asking the IAB to arrange a meaningful liaison with Thread?

Back at Hannes: is there a spec for their approach to security
enrollment?

What would we want to get from a liaison arrangement with Thread?

We had a liaison with ZigBee Alliance but let it lapse as ZA appears to =
have finished its work on Z-IP.

We might also consider a liaison arrangement with Wi-SUN Alliance =
because of the Wi-SUN FAN spec.

As I seem to sit at an intersection of WG chairs and IAB, I can bring up =
the issue if we think there is reason to move forward.

The device can learn from its neighbors about the network state. For instan=
ce, from the bits indicating network ID and device type in hello/beaconing =

 or it is a 'new' device as well, and whether the neighbor has ability to f=

Again, the state can be learnt by exchanging the network ID that devices be=

 >=20
The devices cannot know these things by themselves, but through collaborati=
on it is possible. From this aspect, I do not object that autonomic devices=
 have no state at power-on.

I think the main thing is to have a chance to review their specs before
finalization. They seem to touch numerous IETF WGs directly or
indirectly (at least homenet, anima, 6lo, 6tisch and probably
6man indirectly). Both sides have everything to gain by detecting
misfits and overlaps ASAP.

For instance, from the bits indicating network ID and device type in hello/beaconing message, the device knows whether a neighbor belongs to an existing network or it is a 'new' device as well, and whether the neighbor has ability to forward/verify authentication message.

OK. With my Anima hat on, I see a strong need for a solution that does
not have any specific L2 technology dependence. What you describe here
works for a specific technology with specific bits set in L2 packets.
What we need is a generic solution that doesn't care about which L2
technology is involved, because we are trying to establish trust at
a level above L3 routing.

Agreed.  This is why the netconf-zerotouch drafts have emphasized devices
downloading signed documents, so that it does not matter how the documents
are obtained (usb flash drive vs network, ip vs. optical, v4 vs v6, etc.).

That said, the big difference I see in the homenet/anima vs Enterprise/SP
scenarios is a notion of the device having an "owner".  The NETCONF
ZeroTouch solution keys off tying a serial-number to an "owner" that has
staged some config for the device to find, whereas homenet/anima are more
about having someone in the local environment (e.g, the home) do something
to associate trust between the instance and network.

I believe that these are irreconcilable differences that will drive the
solutions to difference ends.

This is a fine goal, and it may be exactly what 6lo or some other
group should be working on, but I think that it is out of scope for 6tisch.
What we need to do is figure out who to trust to configure a very specific
L2, with very specific constraints.  If we can leverage other more general
work that's great, but the constraints of 4e/TSCH are likely to push
6top-configuration trust in a different direction.

That sounds absolutely reasonable, as long as the various WGs involved
are aware of their own scope and the potential for overlaps. I think
Anima has to ride over these various solutions (and be versatile, since in
some scenarios we can expect pre-registration and in others we can't,
to answer Kent's point).

> Abstract:
>    Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
>    feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
>    Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
>    implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
>    headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
>    is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
>    devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
>    power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
>    the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
>    required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
>    over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.
