Dear authors of draft-ietf-6lo-plc,

As part of the preparation of the shepherd writeup for draft-ietf-6lo-plc,
    I need to ask the following question:

Are you aware of any IPR that applies to this draft?

(Recall that all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance
with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 need to be filed for the most
updated version of the draft, which is -04 as of today.)

I need a response from each author of the draft.

Thank you in advance!

Cheers,

Carles

               Transmission of IPv6 Packets over PLC Networks
                           draft-ietf-6lo-plc-04

  Abstract

     Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
     for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to
     support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart
     meters for electricity.  The inherent advantage of existing
     electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of PLC
     deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices
     raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.  This
     document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained
     PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2  .

  1.  Introduction

     The idea of using power lines for both electricity supply and
     communication can be traced back to the beginning of the last
     century.  With the advantage of existing power grid, Power Line
     Communication (PLC) is a good candidate for supporting various
     service scenarios such as in houses and offices, in trains and
     vehicles, in smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).
     The data acquisition devices in these scenarios share common features

     such as fixed position, large quantity, low data rate and low power
     consumption.

     Although PLC technology has evolved over several decades, it has not
     been fully adapted for IPv6 based constrained networks.  The 6lo
     related scenarios lie in the low voltage PLC networks with most
     applications in the area of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI),
     Vehicle-to-Grid communications, in-home energy management and smart
     street lighting.  IPv6 is important for PLC networks, due to its
     large address space and efficent address auto-configuration.  A
     comparison among various existing PLC standards is provided to
     facilitate the selection of the most applicable standard in
     particular scenarios.

     This specification provides a brief overview of PLC technologies.
     Some of them have LLN characteristics, i.e. limited power

Just a weak suggestion: LLN is a recognized term in many domains.
Nevertheless, feel free to consider using "Constrained-Node Network (CNN)
(see RFC 7228).

     consumption, memory and processing resources.  This specification is
     focused on the transmission of IPv6 packets over those "constrained"
     PLC networks.  The general approach is to adapt elements of the
     6LoWPAN specifications [RFC4944], [RFC6282], and [RFC6775] to

6LoWPAN and 6lo specifications [RFC4944], [RFC6282], [RFC6775], [RFC8505]

     constrained PLC networks.  There was work previously proposed as
     [I-D.popa-6lo-6loplc-ipv6-over-ieee19012-networks], which did not
     reach consensus.  This document provides a more structured
     specification than the previous work, expanding to a larger variety
     of PLC networks.

  2.  Requirements Notation and Terminology

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
     BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
     capitals, as shown here.

     This document often uses the following acronyms and terminologies:

Remove "often"?

     6LoWPAN:  IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network

     AMI:  Advanced Metering Infrastructure

     BBPLC:  Broadband Power Line Communication

     CID:  Context ID

     Coordinator:  A device capable of relaying messages.

     DAD:  Duplicate Address Detection

  3.  Overview of PLC

     PLC technology enables convenient two-way communications for home
     users and utility companies to monitor and control electric plugged
     devices such as electricity meters and street lights.  Due to the
     large range of communication frequencies, PLC is generally classified
     into two categories: Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) for automation of sensors
     (which have low frequency band and low power cost), and Broadband PLC
     (BBPLC) for home and industry networking applications.

     Various standards have been addressed on the MAC and PHY layers for
     this communication technology, e.g., BBPLC (1.8-250 MHz) including
     IEEE 1901 and ITU-T G.hn, and NBPLC (3-500 kHz) including ITU-T
     G.9902 (G.hnem), ITU-T G.9903 (G3-PLC) [ITU-T_G.9903], ITU-T G.9904
     (PRIME), IEEE 1901.2 [IEEE_1901.2] (combination of G3-PLC and PRIME
     PLC) and IEEE 1901.2a [IEEE_1901.2a] (an amendment to IEEE 1901.2) .

     Moreover, recently a new PLC standard IEEE 1901.1 [IEEE_1901.1],
     which aims at the medium frequency band less than 12 MHz, has been

frequency band of less than 12 MHz

     published by the IEEE standard for Smart Grid Powerline Communication
     Working Group (SGPLC WG).  IEEE 1901.1 balances the needs for
     bandwidth versus communication range, and is thus a promising option
     for 6lo applications.

     This specification is focused on IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T
     G.9903.

  3.1.  Protocol Stack

     The protocol stack for IPv6 over PLC is illustrated in Figure 1.  The
     PLC MAC/PHY layer corresponds to IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 or ITU-T
     G.9903.  The 6lo adaptation layer for PLC is illustrated in
     Section 4.  For multihop tree and mesh topologies, a routing protocol
     is likely to be necessary.  The routes can be built in mesh-under
     mode at layer 2 or in route-over mode at layer 3, as explained in
     Section 3.4.

  3.2.  Addressing Modes

     Each PLC device has a globally unique long address of 48-bit
     ([IEEE_1901.1]) or 64-bit ([IEEE_1901.2], [ITU-T_G.9903]) and a short
     address of 12-bit ([IEEE_1901.1]) or 16-bit ([IEEE_1901.2],
     [ITU-T_G.9903]).  The long address is set by the manufacturer
     according to the IEEE EUI-48 MAC address or the IEEE EUI-64 address.
     Each PLC device joins the network by using the long address and
     communicates with other devices by using the short address after
     joining the network.  Short addresses can be assigned during the
     onboarding process, by the PANC or the JRC in CoJP
     [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

Please expand the acronyms JRC and CoJP.


  3.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

     The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the MAC layer determines
     whether fragmentation and reassembly are needed at the adaptation
     layer of IPv6 over PLC.  IPv6 requires an MTU of 1280 octets or
     greater; thus for a MAC layer with MTU lower than this limit,
     fragmentation and reassembly at the adaptation layer are required.

     The IEEE 1901.1 MAC supports upper layer packets up to 2031 octets.
     The IEEE 1901.2 MAC layer supports the MTU of 1576 octets (the
     original value of 1280 bytes was updated in 2015 [IEEE_1901.2a]).
     Though these two technologies can support IPv6 natively without
     fragmentation and reassembly, it is possible to configure a smaller
     MTU in high-noise communication environment.  Thus the 6lo functions,
     including header compression, fragmentation and reassembly, are still
     applicable and useful.

  Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                    June 2020


     The MTU for ITU-T G.9903 is 400 octets, insufficient for supporting
     IPv6's MTU.  For this reason, fragmentation and reassembly as per
     [RFC4944] MUST be enabled for G.9903-based networks.

  3.4.  Routing Protocol

     Routing protocols suitable for use in PLC networks include:

     o  RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) [RFC6550]
        is a layer 3 routing protocol.  AODV-RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl]
        updates RPL to include reactive, point-to-point, and asymmetric
        routing.  IEEE 1901.2 specifies Information Elements (IEs) with
        MAC layer metrics, which can be provided to L3 routing protocol
        for parent selection.  For IPv6-addressable PLC networks, a
        layer-3 routing protocol such as RPL and/or AODV-RPL SHOULD be
        supported in the standard.

Why "SHOULD"?  And if "SHOULD" is the right term here, perhaps add some
clarification on reasons or circumstances motivating using a protocol
different from RPL and/or AODV-RPL?

"in the standard". What does "the standard" refer to here?

     o  IEEE 1901.1 supports L2 routing.  Each PLC node maintains a L2
        routing table, in which each route entry comprises the short
        addresses of the destination and the related next hop.  The route
        entries are built during the network establishment via a pair of
        association request/confirmation messages.  The route entries can
        be changed via a pair of proxy change request/confirmation
        messages.  These association and proxy change messages MUST be
        approved by the central coordinator (PANC in this document).

Regarding the "MUST": is this behavior required by IEEE 1901.1 (i.e. there
is a "MUST" requirement level in IEEE 1901.1 for this?) If yes, then it is
not necessary to capitalize the "MUST" here.

     o  LOADng is a reactive protocol operating at layer 2 or layer 3.
        Currently, LOADng is supported in ITU-T G.9903 [ITU-T_G.9903], and
        the IEEE 1901.2 standard refers to ITU-T G.9903 for LOAD-based
        networks.

  4.  IPv6 over PLC

     However, due to the different characteristics of the PLC media, the
     6LoWPAN adaptation layer cannot perfectly fulfill the requirements.

the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer, as it is, cannot perfectly fulfill the
requirements of PLC environments.

     These considerations suggest the need for a dedicated adaptation
     layer for PLC, which is detailed in the following subsections.

4.1.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

     To obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID), a PLC device performs
     stateless address autoconfiguration [RFC4944].  The autoconfiguration
     can be based on either a long or short link-layer address.

  Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                    June 2020


     The IID can be based on the device's 48-bit MAC address or its EUI-64
     identifier [EUI-64].  A 48-bit MAC address MUST first be extended to

Reference [EUI-64] is missing in the "References" section.

     a 64-bit Interface ID by inserting 0xFFFE at the fourth and fifth
     octets as specified in [RFC2464].  The IPv6 IID is derived from the
     64-bit Interface ID by inverting the U/L bit [RFC4291].

     For IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903, a 48-bit "pseudo-address" is formed
     by the 16-bit PAN ID, 16 zero bits and the 16-bit short address.
     Then, the 64-bit Interface ID MUST be derived by inserting 16-bit
     0xFFFE into as follows:

         16_bit_PAN:00FF:FE00:16_bit_short_address

     For the 12-bit short addresses used by IEEE 1901.1, the 48-bit
     pseudo-address is formed by 24-bit NID (Network IDentifier, YYYYYY),
     12 zero bits and a 12-bit TEI (Terminal Equipment Identifier, XXX).
     The 64-bit Interface ID MUST be derived by inserting 16-bit 0xFFFE
     into this 48-bit pseudo-address as follows:

         YYYY:YYFF:FE00:0XXX

     Since the derived Interface ID is not global, the "Universal/Local"
     (U/L) bit (7th bit) and the Individual/Group bit (8th bit) MUST both
     be set to zero.  In order to avoid any ambiguity in the derived
     Interface ID, these two bits MUST NOT be used to generate the PANID
     (for IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903) or NID (for IEEE 1901.1).  In
     other words, the PANID or NID MUST always be chosen so that these
     bits are zeros.

     For privacy reasons, the IID derived by the MAC address SHOULD only
     be used for link-local address configuration.  A PLC host SHOULD use
     the IID derived by the link-layer short address to configure the IPv6
     address used for communication with the public network; otherwise,
     the host's MAC address is exposed.  Implementations should look at
     [RFC8064] as well, in order to generate a stable IPv6 address using
     an opaque IID.

  4.2.  IPv6 Link Local Address

     The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for a PLC interface is formed
     by appending the IID, as defined above, to the prefix FE80::/64 (see
     Figure 2).

  4.3.  Unicast Address Mapping

     The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses
     into PLC link-layer addresses follows the general description in
     section 7.2 of [RFC4861].  [RFC6775] improves this procedure by
     eliminating usage of multicast NS.  The resolution is realized by the
     NCEs (neighbor cache entry) created during the address registration
     at the routers.  [RFC8505] further improves the registration
     procedure by enabling multiple LLNs to form an IPv6 subnet, and by
     inserting a link-local address registration to better serve proxy
     registration of new devices.

     Neighbor discovery procedures for 6LoWPAN networks are described in
     Neighbor Discovery Optimization for 6LoWPANs [RFC6775] and [RFC8505].

     still be used for power saving.

     For IPv6 address prefix dissemination, Router Solicitations (RS) and
     Router Advertisements (RA) MAY be used as per [RFC6775].  If the PLC
     network uses route-over mesh, the IPv6 prefix MAY be disseminated by

such as RPL, which may include

     in the DIO message.  As per [I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves], it is
     possible to have PLC devices configured as RPL-unaware-leaves, which
     don't not participate to RPL at all, along with RPL-aware PLC

s/don't not/do not

     devices.  In this case, the prefix dissemination SHOULD use the RS/RA
     messages.

I understand that the route-over routing protocol is not specified, right?
I.e. this document supports any route-over routing protocol. If yes, then
you may want to use more generic terms, such as "If the route-over routing
protocol does not support prefix dissemination", which replaces "In this
case".

     For context information dissemination, Router Advertisements (RA)
     MUST be used as per [RFC6775].  The 6LoWPAN context option (6CO) MUST
     be included in the RA to disseminate the Context IDs used for prefix
     compression.

s/prefix compression/prefix and/or address compression

     For address registration in route-over mode, a PLC device MUST
     register its addresses by sending unicast link-local Neighbor
     Solicitation to the 6LR.  If the registered address is link-local,
     the 6LR SHOULD NOT further register it to the registrar (6LBR, 6BBR).
     Otherwise, the address MUST be registered via an ARO or EARO included
     in the DAR ([RFC6775]) or EDAR ([RFC8505]) messages.  For RFC8505
     compliant PLC devices, the 'R' flag in the EARO MUST be set when
     sending Neighbor Solicitaitons in order to extract the status
     information in the replied Neighbor Advertisements from the 6LR.  If
     DHCPv6 is used to assign addresses or the IPv6 address is derived by

     unique long or short link layer address, Duplicate Address Detection
     (DAD) MUST NOT be utilized.  Otherwise, the DAD MUST be performed at
     the 6LBR (as per [RFC6775]) or proxied by the routing registrar (as
     per [RFC8505]).  The registration status is feedbacked via the DAC or
     EDAC message from the 6LBR and the Neighbor Advertisement (NA) from
     the 6LR.

     devices are the link-local neighbors to the 6LBR, DAR/DAC or EDAR/

     registration status is feedbacked via the NA message from the 6LBR.

  4.5.  Header Compression

     The compression of IPv6 datagrams within PLC MAC frames refers to
     [RFC6282], which updates [RFC4944].  Header compression as defined in
     [RFC6282] which specifies the compression format for IPv6 datagrams
     on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is included in this document as the basis

     for IPv6 header compression in PLC.  For situations when PLC MAC MTU
     cannot support the 1280-octet IPv6 packet, headers MUST be compressed
     according to [RFC6282] encoding formats.

IEEE 1901.1 supports 12-bit and 48-bit addresses. Header compression over
IEEE 1901.1 will need some form of adaptation, since RFC 6282 refers to
16-bit and 64-bit addresses.

  Internet-Draft                IPv6 over PLC                    June 2020


  4.6.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

     PLC differs from other wired technologies in that the communication
     medium is not shielded; thus, to successfully transmit data through
     power lines, PLC Data Link layer provides the function of
     segmentation and reassembly.  A Segment Control Field is defined in
     the MAC frame header regardless of whether segmentation is required.
     The number of data octets of the PHY payload can change dynamically
     based on channel conditions, thus the MAC payload segmentation in the
     MAC sublayer is enabled and guarantees a reliable one-hop data
     transmission.  Fragmentation and reassembly is still required at the
     adaptation layer, if the MAC layer cannot support the minimum MTU
     demanded by IPv6, which is 1280 octets.

     In IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2, the MAC layer supports payloads as
     big as 2031 octets and 1576 octets respectively.  However when the
     channel condition is noisy, it is possible to configure smaller MTU
     at the MAC layer.  If the configured MTU is smaller than 1280
     octects, the fragmentation and reassembly defined in [RFC4944] MUST
     be used.

     In ITU-T G.9903, the maximum MAC payload size is fixed to 400 octets,
     so to cope with the required MTU of 1280 octets by IPv6,
     fragmentation and reassembly at 6lo adaptation layer MUST be provided
     referring to [RFC4944].

  5.  Internet Connectivity Scenarios and Topologies

   The network model can be simplified to two kinds of network devices:

s/The network model/The PLC network model

   PAN Coordinator (PANC) and PAN Device.  The PANC is the primary
   coordinator of the PLC subnet and can be seen as a master node; PAN
   Devices are typically PLC meters and sensors.  The PANC also serves
   as the Routing Registrar for proxy registration and DAD procedures,
   making use of the updated registration procedures in [RFC8505].  IPv6
   over PLC networks are built as tree, mesh or star according to the
   use cases.  Every network requires at least one PANC to communicate
   with each PAN Device.

The last sentence was unclear. Who/What communicates with each PAN Device?

                         Note that the PLC topologies in this section
   are based on logical connectivity, not physical links.

   The star topology is common in current PLC scenarios.  In single-hop
   star topologies, communication at the link layer only takes place
   between a PAN Device and a PANC.  The PANC typically collects data
   (e.g., a meter reading) from the PAN devices, and then concentrates
   and uploads the data through Ethernet or LPWAN (see Figure 5).  The
   collected data is transmitted by the smart meters through PLC,
   aggregated by a concentrator, sent to the utility and then to a Meter
   Data Management System for data storage, analysis and billing.  This

   topology has been widely applied in the deployment of smart meters,
   especially in apartment buildings.

   A tree topology is useful when the distance between a device A and
   PANC is beyond the PLC allowed limit and there is another device B in
   between able to communicate with both sides.  Device B in this case
   acts both as a PAN Device and a Coordinator.  For this scenario, the
   link layer communications take place between device A and device B,
   and between device B and PANC.  An example of PLC tree network is
   depicted in Figure 6.  This topology can be applied in the smart
   street lighting, where the lights adjust the brightness to reduce
   energy consumption while sensors are deployed on the street lights to
   provide information such as light intensity, temperature, humidity.
   Data transmission distance in the street lighting scenario is
   normally above several kilometers thus the PLC tree network is
   required.  A more sophisticated AMI network may also be constructed
   into the tree topology which is depicted in [RFC8036].  A tree
   topology is suitable for AMI scenarios that require large coverage
   but low density, e.g., the deployment of smart meters in rural areas.
   RPL is suitable for maintenance of a tree topology in which there is
   no need for communication directly between PAN devices.

   Mesh networking in PLC is of great potential applications and has
   been studied for several years.  By connecting all nodes with their
   neighbors in communication range (see Figure 7), mesh topology
   dramatically enhances the communication efficiency and thus expands
   the size of PLC networks.  A simple use case is the smart home
   scenario where the ON/OFF state of air conditioning is controlled by
   the state of home lights (ON/OFF) and doors (OPEN/CLOSE).  AODV-RPL
   enables direct PAN device to PAN device communication, without being
   obliged to transmit frames through the PANC, which is a requirement
   often cited for AMI infrastructure.

What is the subnet model for the scenarios illustrated in this section?
For example, is the "PLC subnet" a multilink subnet? Is each link in the
"PLC subnet" a subnet?

Perhaps this text from RFC 7668 may be useful for reference:

   "In the Bluetooth LE case, the benefits of treating
   the collection of point-to-point links between a central and its
   connected peripherals as a single multilink subnet rather than a
   multiplicity of separate subnets are considered to outweigh the
   multilink model's drawbacks as described in [RFC4903]."

  6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

  7.  Security Consideration

   Due to the high accessibility of power grid, PLC might be susceptible
   to eavesdropping within its communication coverage, e.g., one
   apartment tenant may have the chance to monitor the other smart
   meters in the same apartment building.  For security consideration,
   link layer security is guaranteed in every PLC technology.

   Malicious PLC devices could paralyze the whole network via DOS
   attacks, e.g., keep joining and leaving the network frequently, or
   multicast routing messages containing fake metrics.  A device may
   also join a wrong or even malicious network, exposing its data to
   illegal users.  Mutual authentication of network and new device can
   be conducted during the onboarding process of the new device.
   Methods include protocols such as [RFC7925] (exchanging pre-installed
   certificates over DTLS) , [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] (which
   uses pre-shared keys), and
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join] (which uses IDevID and
   MASA service).  It is also possible to use EAP methods such as
   [I-D.ietf-emu-eap-noob] via transports like PANA [RFC5191].  No
   specific mechanism is specified by this document as an appropriate
   mechanism will depend upon deployment circumstances.  The network
   encryption key appropriate for the layer-2 can also be acquired
   during the onboarding process.

   IP addresses may be used to track devices on the Internet; such
   devices can in turn be linked to individuals and their activities.
   Depending on the application and the actual use pattern, this may be
   undesirable.  To impede tracking, globally unique and non-changing
   characteristics of IP addresses should be avoided, e.g., by
   frequently changing the global prefix and avoiding unique link-layer
   derived IIDs in addresses.  [RFC3315], [RFC3972], [RFC4941],
   [RFC5535], [RFC7217], and [RFC8065] provide valuable information for
   IID formation with improved privacy, and are RECOMMENDED for IPv6
   networks.

Dear authors,

Thanks for your responses.

The shepherd writeup is almost ready, pending a confirmation of the
updates in the upcoming -05.

When -05 is published, I will check the draft again (including an
additional  ID nits tool check). I then plan to submit the shepherd
writeup, and request publication of the document.

Thanks,

Carles

Dear authors of draft-ietf-6lo-nfc,

Thanks for updating the draft and producing revision -16.

In my opinion, the document has improved. I checked the document again,
and I have another round of comments. Perhaps just one more iteration to
address this round of comments might suffice to proceed to the next step.

Please find below my comments on -16.

Cheers,

Carles (shepherd of draft-ietf-6lo-nfc)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.- Section 3.1, 2nd line: s/enables/allows (this is to avoid repeating
the same term so quickly in the text).

2.- Section 3.1, 1st paragraph:

CURRENT:
information and share files, so that users of NFC-enabled devices can
quickly share contact information and other files with a touch. The other
two modes does not support two-way communications between two devices.
Therefore, the peer mode is used for ipv6-over-nfc.

PROPOSED:
information bidirectionally. The other two modes do not support two-way
communications between two devices. Therefore, the peer-to-peer mode is
used for IPv6 over NFC.

3.- Section 3.2 title: s/Stacks/Stack

4.- Section 3.2, 1st paragraph:

CURRENT:
The peer-to-peer mode is made in Activities Digital Protocol in NFC
Physical Lay. The NFC Logical Link consists of

PROPOSED:
The peer-to-peer mode is offered by the Activities Digital Protocol at the
NFC Physical Layer. The NFC Logical Link Layer consists of

5.- Section 3.2, 2nd sentence: does this sentence apply always, or only
when IPv6 is used over NFC?  If the latter, then some proposed text is as
follows:
"The NFC Logical Link Layer comprises the Logical Link Control Protocol
(LLCP), and when IPv6 is used over NFC, it also includes an IPv6-LLCP
Binding"

6.- Section 3.2, 2nd paragraph. Please stick to one term for the whole
document ("Connection-less" and "Connectionless" are both used in the
paragraph).

7.- Section 3.2, last paragraph, 2nd sentence:

   s/LLCP/The LLCP  (first "LLCP" instance)
   s/LLCP/the LLCP  (second "LLCP" instance)

8.- Section 3.2, last paragraph:

CURRENT:
The LLCP to IPv6 protocol binding MUST transfer the SSAP and DSAP value to
the IPv6 over NFC protocol. SSAP stands for Source Service Access Point,
which is a 6-bit value meaning a kind of Logical Link Control (LLC)
address

PROPOSED:
The LLCP to IPv6 protocol binding MUST transfer the Source Service Access
Point (SSAP) and Destination Service Access Point (DSAP) value
to the IPv6 over NFC protocol. SSAP is a Logical Link Control (LLC)
address of the source NFC-enabled device with a size of 6 bits.

9.- Section 3.3: s/Logical Link Control Protocol/LLCP

10.- Section 3.4, 1st paragraph: there may be a bit of confusion regarding
the concepts of I PDU and UI PDU. In previous sections, there seem to be
the I field of a PDU and the UI field of a PDU. However, it seems like now
there is a definition of two different types of PDUs (I PDU and UI PDU).
Are
"I PDU" and "UI PDU" different and exclusive types of PDU? Can a given PDU
carry an I field and a UI field?

Clarifications are needed regarding these terms.

11.- Section 3.4, 2nd paragraph. Only "I PDU" is mentioned here. What
about UI PDUs?

12.- Section 3.4, last paragraph. If the maximum possible value of the TLV
Value field is 0x7FF, wouldn't the maximum possible value of the LLCP MTU
be 2175 bytes instead of 2176?

13.- Section 3.4, last paragraph:

CURRENT:
If fragmentation functionality is not used at the
adaptation layer between IPv6 and NFC, the MIUX value MUST be 0x480 to
support the IPv6 MTU requirement (of 1280 bytes).

PROPOSED:
The MIUX value MUST be 0x480 to support the IPv6 MTU requirement (of 1280
bytes).

14.- Section 4, 1st paragraph:
CURRENT:
NFC technology also has considerations and requirements

PROPOSED:
NFC technology has requirements

15.- Section 4, 1st paragraph:
CURRENT:
reducing overhead which can be applied to NFC

PROPOSED:
reducing the overhead of IPv6 over NFC

16.- Section 4, 1st paragraph: s/see Section 4.2/see Section 4.2 and
Section 4.3.

17.- Section 4.1 title: s/Stacks/Stack

18.- Section 4.1: s/Figure 3 illustrates IPv6 over NFC/Figure 3
illustrates the IPv6 over NFC protocol stack

19.- Figure 3. (Just a suggestion.) Perhaps close the upper part of the
figure, i.e. adding a horizontal line closing the box for "Upper Layer
Protocols"?

20.- Figure 3: in Figure 1 there is the term "NFC Logical Link Layer". Is
this the same as "NFC Link Layer"? If yes, please stick to the same term
in both figures.

21.- Section 4.2, 3rd paragraph: s/the algorithm, F()/the F() algorithm

22.- Section 4.2, 3rd paragraph: s/easy and short/short and easy

23.- Section 4.2, 3rd paragraph: s/The F() can provide/The F() algorithm
can provide

24.- Section 4.3, 1st sentence: s/appending the IID, to/appending the IID to

25.- Section 4.3, last sentence: s/IIDs/IID
26.- Section 4.4. When mentioning RFC 6775, you may probably want to cite
RFC 8505. Likewise, the ARO is now an Extended Address Registration Option
(EARO), as per RFC 8505.

27.- Section 4.4, 2nd bullet: remove "(e.g., isolated network)". Note that
two NFC devices might still talk to each other (point-to-point topology),
but one of them may be connected to the Internet.

28.- Section 4.4, 2nd bullet: s / play a router for 6LR/6LBR / may act as
routers

29.- Section 4.5, 1st paragraph: s/6LoWPAN_IPHC/LOWPAN_IPHC compressed
IPv6 header (see section 4.6)

30.- Section 4.7:

CURRENT:
IPv6-over-NFC SHOULD NOT use fragmentation and reassembly (FAR) for the
payloads as discussed in Section 3.4. The NFC link connection
for IPv6 over NFC MUST be configured with an equivalent MIU size to fit
the MTU of IPv6 Packet. The MIUX value is 0x480 in order to fit the MTU
(1280 bytes) of a IPv6 packet if NFC devices support
extension of the MTU.

PROPOSED:
IPv6-over-NFC MUST NOT use fragmentation and reassembly (FAR) at the
adaptation layer for the payloads as discussed in Section 3.4. The NFC
link connection for IPv6 over NFC MUST be configured with an equivalent
MIU size to support the IPv6 MTU requirement (of 1280 bytes). To this end,
the MIUX value is 0x480.

31.- Section 5, 1st paragraph: s/in link layer/at the link layer

32.- Section 5.1 title: s/NFC-enabled Device Connected to the
Internet/NFC-enabled Device Network Connected to the Internet

33.- Section 5.1, 1st paragraph:

CURRENT:
Figure 10 illustrates an example of an NFC-enabled device network
connected to the Internet. The distance between 6LN and 6LBR is
typically 10 cm or less. If there is any laptop computers close to a
user, it will become a 6LBR. Additionally, when the user mounts an
NFC-enabled air interface adapter (e.g., portable NFC dongle) on the
close laptop PC, the users NFC-enabled device (6LN) can communicate
with the laptop PC (6LBR) within 10 cm distance.

PROPOSED:
Figure 10 illustrates an example of an NFC-enabled device network
connected to the Internet. The distance between 6LN and 6LBR is
typically 10 cm or less. For example, a laptop computer that is connected
to the Internet (e.g. via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.) may also support NFC and
act as a 6LBR. Another NFC-enabled device may run as a 6LN and communicate
with the 6LBR, as long as both are within each other's range.

34.- Figure 10: please fix the couple of vertical lines that are shifted
to the right.

35.- Section 5.1, last paragraph: s/Two or more 6LNs are/Two or more 6LNs
may be

36.- Section 5.2: is "transiently" the only case where a network may be
isolated? I.e. could such a network be *permanently* isolated?

37.- Section 5.2. Please indicate the subnet model.

38.- Section 7, 1st line:

CURRENT:
There are the intrinsic security properties of NFC due to its short
link range.

PROPOSED:
NFC is often considered to offer intrinsic security properties due to its
short link range.

39.- Section 7, 2nd paragraph: does "Short Address" need to be capitalized
here?

Abstract:
   Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
   and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other
   by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no
   more than 10 cm apart.  NFC standards cover communications protocols
   and data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.
   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC
   Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available
   in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This
   document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LoWPAN
   techniques.
