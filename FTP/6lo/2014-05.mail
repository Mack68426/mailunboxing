Hello Fernando, all,

I would expect that at least RFC 6282 (and perhaps the RFC 4944 which it up=
dates?) should be mentioned, since the 6LoWPAN header compression is based =
on the IID containing the hardware address. This RFC is then a notable exce=
ption to the 'SHOULD NOT'.

Furthermore for the 6lo active WG documents:
- draft-ietf-6lo-btle-00 has the use of hardware address for IID as a 'MAY'=
 - that would need to become a 'SHOULD NOT' (unless there is some negative =
impact on performance) ?
- draft-ietf-6lo-lowpanz-04 has a MUST on the use of NodeID in the IID, how=
ever the NodeID is only 8-bit locally assigned and is not an identifiable h=
ardware address.
- for draft-ietf-6lo-ghc I don't see issues
- for draft-ietf-6lo-lowpan-mib I don't see issues

regards,
Esko

Subject: [6lo] Generation of IPv6 IIDs

Folks,

We recently contacted the 6lo chairs asking whether there were any 6lo-rela=
ted documents that should be mentioned in the "Updates" of our
I-D: <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-default-iids>.

We briefly discussed this off-list, and they suggested that raised this on =
this list.

Here's the summary of our exchange:

Samita and Ulrich kindly noted that at least some 6lo document does IPv6 ad=
dress compression on the assumption that the IID contains the underlying ha=
rdware address.

On the other hand we noted that:

* Some OSes (notably Microsoft Windows) have moved away from embedding MAC =
addresses in the IIDs (to mitigate the issues discussed in <http://tools.ie=
tf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy>).

* Additionally, there's an existing 6man recommendation (in RFC 7136) again=
st expecting any semantics in the IPv6 IIDs -- the IID should be treated as=
 a string of opaque bits.

Dave Thaler had already posted some related comments on this list that are =
related to this issue. Please see:

* <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/msg00403.html>

As noted by Dave (and also by myself), there seem to be some statements in =
6lo documents which seem to go against some 6man recommendations.
That said, in the specific case of header compression, you might have a cas=
e to go against the "SHOULD NOT" in <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-=
6man-default-iids> -- although expecting specific semantics in the IPv6 IID=
s still goes against RFC 7136.


All the above said, we still wonder if there are any 6lo-related documents =
we should include in the "Updates" of draft-ietf-6man-default-iids.

P.S.: I apologize if some of the above comments are not that timely...
but I was not following the 6lo work.

Thanks!

Best regards,
--

I am not sure I understood you, do you mean there is no support and still
we got to WGLC. I thought if we are in WGLC then the draft is supported and
agreed to go through LC with WG. For me I was not able to review, but my
current interest is to make it explain more on 6lo mib considerations (but
the WGLC was finished so maybe we can submit).

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2418#section-7.4

The purpose is to determine if there is consensus within the WG to
send this document forward (in this case, MIB doctor review, then IETF
LC). There may also be more comments that require new revisions of the
draft, potentially followed by another WGLC. Another good read is:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026

As there was only a single reply from the WG participants, the chairs
cannot determine whether there is consensus inside the WG to publish
this document as is. What we would like to see is that several
participants express their support for publication of this document.
This was agreed on with Brian, our responsible AD.

Best regards
UIrich

Fernando,

Are you planning on specifying all the possible protocols tweaks that 
might be needed to existing RFCs in draft-ietf-6man-default-iids?
Unless you do you can't claim that it updates those RFCs.
And that would be completely unwieldy.

I think it would be better to progress default-iids with
  - SHOULD implement stable-privacy
  - SHOULD use stable-privacy as default where it works (such as Ethernet)
  - state that some issues have been identified in RFC X, Y, Z, as as 
those get addressed the SHOULD use will be applied to those as well.

That way you avoid having to design all the solutions before 
default-iids can be progressed in 6man.


RFC 6775 (6lowpan-nd) makes the assumption that the host always has a 
link-local address configured with the EUI-64 of the host.
That assumption is used in section 6.5.2 to send errors back to hosts.
Note that we already know of a solution, which is local to the router 
implementation, which is already captured in section 9.7 in 
draft-chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd. 6lo might consider taking 
that suggestion and having either a short document which updates 6775 or 
doing a 6775-bis if there are other desirable updates (I think a 
transaction ID in the ARO is such another desirable update).

But IMHO we shouldn't have any such work hold up 
draft-ietf-6man-default-iids.

Regards,
    Erik

It is also worth noting the different scopes the IIDs can be used in. If =

the address is globally routable, there is certainly a case for adopting =

privacy addresses. However, for link local addresses, especially in a=20
route-over mesh where a link-local IP packet travels strictly one node=20
hop, it does not seem as critical. As mentioned below, in many cases=20
6LoWPAN compression relies on a one-to-one correspondence between a link =

local and IPv6 address to provide effective compression.

Also, it should be pointed out that the privacy concerns over IPv6 and
IIDs has to do more with lifetime of the IID rather than the fact that
they just so happens to be bound to routeable addresses. In 6LoWPAN, the
IID is bound to a routable address to aid in address compression, but
the IIDs themselves are often based on ephemeral link layer addresses
that could easily be reassigned periodically* to aid user privacy.

Cheers,
Owen

* they could be easily reassigned in IEEE 802.15.4, I'm not enough of a

      If the address is globally routable, there is certainly a case for
      adopting privacy addresses. However, for link local addresses,
      especially in a route-over mesh where a link-local IP packet
      travels strictly one node hop, it does not seem as critical. As

        compression is based on the IID containing the hardware address.
        This RFC is then a notable exception to the 'SHOULD NOT'.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore for the 6lo active WG documents:
        <br>
        - draft-ietf-6lo-btle-00 has the use of hardware address for IID
        as a 'MAY' - that would need to become a 'SHOULD NOT' (unless
        there is some negative impact on performance) ?
        <br>
        - draft-ietf-6lo-lowpanz-04 has a MUST on the use of NodeID in
        the IID, however the NodeID is only 8-bit locally assigned and
        is not an identifiable hardware address.
        <br>
        - for draft-ietf-6lo-ghc I don't see issues
        <br>
        - for draft-ietf-6lo-lowpan-mib I don't see issues
        <br>

        Subject: [6lo] Generation of IPv6 IIDs
        <br>
        <br>
        Folks,
        <br>
        <br>
        We recently contacted the 6lo chairs asking whether there were
        any 6lo-related documents that should be mentioned in the
        "Updates" of our
        <br>
        I-D:
        <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-default-iids">&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-default-iids&gt;</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        We briefly discussed this off-list, and they suggested that
        raised this on this list.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here's the summary of our exchange:
        <br>
        <br>
        Samita and Ulrich kindly noted that at least some 6lo document
        does IPv6 address compression on the assumption that the IID
        contains the underlying hardware address.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand we noted that:
        <br>
        <br>
        * Some OSes (notably Microsoft Windows) have moved away from
        embedding MAC addresses in the IIDs (to mitigate the issues
        discussed in
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy">&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy&gt;</a>).<br>
        <br>
        * Additionally, there's an existing 6man recommendation (in RFC
        7136) against expecting any semantics in the IPv6 IIDs -- the
        IID should be treated as a string of opaque bits.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dave Thaler had already posted some related comments on this
        list that are related to this issue. Please see:
        <br>
        <br>
        *
        <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/msg00403.html">&lt;http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/6lo/current/msg00403.html&gt;</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        As noted by Dave (and also by myself), there seem to be some
        statements in 6lo documents which seem to go against some 6man
        recommendations.
        <br>
        That said, in the specific case of header compression, you might
        have a case to go against the "SHOULD NOT" in
        <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-default-iids">&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-default-iids&gt;</a>
        -- although expecting specific semantics in the IPv6 IIDs still
        goes against RFC 7136.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        All the above said, we still wonder if there are any 6lo-related
        documents we should include in the "Updates" of
        draft-ietf-6man-default-iids.
        <br>
        <br>
        P.S.: I apologize if some of the above comments are not that
        timely...
        <br>
        but I was not following the 6lo work.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks!
        <br>
        <br>

Abstract:
   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the low energy feature in the
   Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth Special Interest
   Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely implemented and
   available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and
   many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth is a
   specification that enables the use of this air interface with devices
   such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low power
   variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of the
   Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is required
   for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported over
   Bluetooth Low Energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Hi all,

Here is the next revision of IPv6 over Bluetooth LE. This version includes =
at least:
- Changed to use Connection Oriented Channels instead of fixed L2CAP Channe=
l Identifier, and all it implies
- Fixed branding related feedback in how Bluetooth trademarked name is to b=
e used
- Fixed several comments received outside of 6lo WG list
- Fixed header compression section, but I think that needs further work..
- Attempted to fix Dave Thaler's recent feedback on this list

All comments & questions welcome.

Best regards,

	Teemu

I strongly agreement with Erik's comments.  SHOULDs and identify the non 
aligned RFCs.

6775 is a perfect example.

Hello All:

I have reviewed Ander's -04 version of the draft http://datatracker.ietf.or=
g/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-lowpanz/  and provided comments off-line.

Anders have been working on updating the documents and almost ready for the=
 next revisions with the updates.

The comments are mostly editorial and clarification at this point as it is =
moving to the next step - being the first document to move forward after WG=
LC.

Here is a summary of my comments:



1. Add definition for "mesh-under" and "route-over". Also add definition fo=
r "logical networks" that you used several times in the context of G.9959

2. Clarification needed on "home id" definition and add reference to EUI-64=
 reference
3. Add reference to ULA  RFC 4193

General comment on 'definition of terms':  Please add more text to provide =
a short definition rather than acronym expansion

4. How about adding a section on "G.9959 Topology for IPv6 Transport" ?  Fr=
om the document it is not clear whether the network-controller is also acti=
ng as ABR?, whether you have multi-hop subnets or only one hop subnet ? A d=
iagram will help or a section describing the typical topology is needed for=
 understading.

5. Please provide a mapping example as to how to map the homeid into the Ip=
v6 subnet.  Does it mean that the controller gets a /48 prefix and then add=
 the homeid to the 16bit to make it a /64 prefix?

6. section 2.1 - Clarify what it means by complying with RFC 6775 when M bi=
t is on

7. Section 2.4 - is this section trying to say that transmission status ind=
ication is useful for reliable and efficient implementation for handling fr=
agmented packets? If so, please clarify.
8. Section 3.1 -- says "Non-6LoWPAN protocols MUST ignore the contents foll=
owing the 6LoWPAN Command
Class identifier." ---Please explain a bit in details.

8. Section 4.4.2 -- " An implementation for mesh-under operation MUST use R=
FC6775 for managing IPv6 prefixes"  contradicts with section 4.4 "Mesh-unde=
r networks MUST NOT use RFC 6775 address registration" -- Requires clarific=
ation and reference to sections of RFC6775 to say which sections to impleme=
nt and which one to skip.

9. section 4.4.2.1 -- Needs clarification/clear text on M flag behavior whe=
n it is ON.

10. Appendix A-- HLIM field should be '10' in the last diagram example on p=
age 16.

11. s/Hext header/Next header

Are you referring to the corresponding 6lo documents, or the "ipv6 over
foo" documents we currently have in the "Updates" metadata?

Why not explicitly updating the "ipv6 over foo" documents in those cases
where stable-privacy does work?

FWIW, I believe the "Updates" tag is important, such that folks
implementing "ipv6 over foo" are somehow directed to default-iids...

I believe the only "issue" has been that related with header compression
in 6lo.

I gues one possible option is simply to not reference the aforementioned
RFC ni the "Updates", or maybe even do reference it, but consider such
case as a valid reason to go against the "SHOULD"/"SHOULD NOT" in
default-iids..

Thoughts? (i.e., take the above as brain-storming, rather than as a
strong statement)

I certainly think that deafult-iids should wait for other work to be
progressed. If anything, it should be the other way around.

Agreed.

Thanks so much for your feedback! Please find my responses in-line....

Since this one does not really follow the "SHOULD NOT", I guess we might
opt to:

a) List the RFC as "There are issues with this specification" (as
suggested by Erik), or,

b) Do not mention this RFC at all.


Thoughts?

I'd suggest that draft-ietf-6man-default-iids is referenced in that I-D.
Then you either follow the advice in draft-ietf-6man-default-iids, or
explain your reasoning to go against it. (this was suggested by Dave
Thaler earlier on).

I'll check the aforementioned I-D when I land (I'm currently on a
plane). I'd note that the issue is not only about IIDs being derived
from hardware addresses, but also about they being constant across
different network attachment points.

Thanks so much!

The link-local case has been discussed within 6man already. Short
summary: these addresses can link (think e.g. a node contacting an MTA
on the local network, and then the link-local address leaking out via
the email headers).

Predictable/constant addresses is something with well-known
implications. We should move away from them.

Thanks, Samita

I have corrected the nits and replaced the M flag text with a more clear ta=
ble.
Definitions have been added as well as a few explanations.

With regards to your request for a topology discussion:
This document was created to be 100% topology agnostic. The addressing,
encapsulation and header compression techniques work the same way
whether the network implements one-hop only or multi-hop subnets.
Thus, such a section would not really make sense.
Though, I have added a recommendation that the G.9959 network control
is integrated in the ABR.

I believe that I have addressed all the below comments and therefore, I
have submitted a new -05 revision of the draft. ... and this very moment,
I am realising that I forgot to add a section to the change log for the -04=
 to
-05 transition.
I have added it offline, but I see no reason for submitting a -06 revision
just for adding a change log section.
A -04 - -05 diff file has been attached to this mail.

Thanks,
  Anders.

Subject: Review comments on draft-ietf-6lo-lopwpanz

Hello All:

I have reviewed Ander's -04 version of the draft http://datatracker.ietf.or=
g/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-lowpanz/  and provided comments off-line.

Anders have been working on updating the documents and almost ready for the=
 next revisions with the updates.

The comments are mostly editorial and clarification at this point as it is =
moving to the next step - being the first document to move forward after WG=
LC.

Here is a summary of my comments:



1. Add definition for "mesh-under" and "route-over". Also add definition fo=
r "logical networks" that you used several times in the context of G.9959

2. Clarification needed on "home id" definition and add reference to EUI-64=
 reference
3. Add reference to ULA  RFC 4193

General comment on 'definition of terms':  Please add more text to provide =
a short definition rather than acronym expansion

4. How about adding a section on "G.9959 Topology for IPv6 Transport" ?  Fr=
om the document it is not clear whether the network-controller is also acti=
ng as ABR?, whether you have multi-hop subnets or only one hop subnet ? A d=
iagram will help or a section describing the typical topology is needed for=
 understading.

5. Please provide a mapping example as to how to map the homeid into the Ip=
v6 subnet.  Does it mean that the controller gets a /48 prefix and then add=
 the homeid to the 16bit to make it a /64 prefix?

6. section 2.1 - Clarify what it means by complying with RFC 6775 when M bi=
t is on

7. Section 2.4 - is this section trying to say that transmission status ind=
ication is useful for reliable and efficient implementation for handling fr=
agmented packets? If so, please clarify.
8. Section 3.1 -- says "Non-6LoWPAN protocols MUST ignore the contents foll=
owing the 6LoWPAN Command
Class identifier." ---Please explain a bit in details.

8. Section 4.4.2 -- " An implementation for mesh-under operation MUST use R=
FC6775 for managing IPv6 prefixes"  contradicts with section 4.4 "Mesh-unde=
r networks MUST NOT use RFC 6775 address registration" -- Requires clarific=
ation and reference to sections of RFC6775 to say which sections to impleme=
nt and which one to skip.

9. section 4.4.2.1 -- Needs clarification/clear text on M flag behavior whe=
n it is ON.

10. Appendix A-- HLIM field should be '10' in the last diagram example on p=
age 16.

11. s/Hext header/Next header

While I don't necessarily disagree with doing any privacy-wise
improvements at the link-layer, that's mostly orthogonal to what we're
discussing here.

Several things to note:

* Firstly (and most importantly), traditional SLAAC IIDs mean that the
IID has the same properties as the underlying MAC address. That's where
the problem resides.  If you play with the underlying MAC address,
you're not solving that problem.

* If you do simple MAC-address-randomization + traditional SLAAC, that
would lead to IPv6 addresses that change over time, even when that's not
really desirable. In order to know where such change might be desirable,
you would need to do some sort flavor of RFC6059.. but most of the
"hints" there are not available at layer-2.

* The scale of the problem is different between MAC address privacy vs.
IPv6 address privacy: In order to exploit the former, you essentially
need a rogue device connected to the victim's network. In order to
exploit the later, you just need to be connected to the Internet.

* Finally, there could even be cases where the MAC address is not
changeable (for one reason or another).

Thanks,

Hi,

I agree with J=C3=BCrgen's argument that the current solution with the
interface table and a conformance group allows devices to not
implement per-interface statistics if they don't need/want to. This
saves the space for devices that are either too constrained or that
only have one interface. As J=C3=BCrgen pointed out, in the first case they
could still sum things up. In some cases the sum may be sufficient,
but I could imagine that for debugging it may be helpful to know
counters for a specific interface.
If I am not mistaken, the current specification allows already what
Peter suggests, namely to use the sum instead of individual interface
counters, if so desired.

Best regards
Ulrich

Thanks, Samita

I have corrected the nits and replaced the M flag text with a more clear ta=
ble.
Definitions have been added as well as a few explanations.

With regards to your request for a topology discussion:
This document was created to be 100% topology agnostic. The addressing,
encapsulation and header compression techniques work the same way
whether the network implements one-hop only or multi-hop subnets.
Thus, such a section would not really make sense.
Though, I have added a recommendation that the G.9959 network control
is integrated in the ABR.
I believe that I have addressed all the below comments and therefore, I
have submitted a new -05 revision of the draft. ... and this very moment,
I am realising that I forgot to add a section to the change log for the -04=
 to
-05 transition.
I have added it offline, but I see no reason for submitting a -06 revision
just for adding a change log section.
A -04 - -05 diff file has been attached to this mail.

Thanks,
  Anders.

Subject: Review comments on draft-ietf-6lo-lopwpanz

Hello All:

I have reviewed Ander's -04 version of the draft http://datatracker.ietf.or=
g/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-lowpanz/  and provided comments off-line.

Anders have been working on updating the documents and almost ready for the=
 next revisions with the updates.

The comments are mostly editorial and clarification at this point as it is =
moving to the next step - being the first document to move forward after WG=
LC.

Here is a summary of my comments:



1. Add definition for "mesh-under" and "route-over". Also add definition fo=
r "logical networks" that you used several times in the context of G.9959

2. Clarification needed on "home id" definition and add reference to EUI-64=
 reference
3. Add reference to ULA  RFC 4193

General comment on 'definition of terms':  Please add more text to provide =
a short definition rather than acronym expansion

4. How about adding a section on "G.9959 Topology for IPv6 Transport" ?  Fr=
om the document it is not clear whether the network-controller is also acti=
ng as ABR?, whether you have multi-hop subnets or only one hop subnet ? A d=
iagram will help or a section describing the typical topology is needed for=
 understading.

5. Please provide a mapping example as to how to map the homeid into the Ip=
v6 subnet.  Does it mean that the controller gets a /48 prefix and then add=
 the homeid to the 16bit to make it a /64 prefix?

6. section 2.1 - Clarify what it means by complying with RFC 6775 when M bi=
t is on

7. Section 2.4 - is this section trying to say that transmission status ind=
ication is useful for reliable and efficient implementation for handling fr=
agmented packets? If so, please clarify.
8. Section 3.1 -- says "Non-6LoWPAN protocols MUST ignore the contents foll=

Hi J=C3=BCrgen,

I have an additional question:

On Wed, Apr 30, 2014 at 5:02 AM, Juergen Schoenwaelder
<j.schoenwaelder@jacobs-university.de> wrote:

Allowing this "sum" of interface counters (and explicitly mentioning
that this is possible) could be useful as addition to support of the
more verbose per-interface counters. In this case, do you think we
need some flag to indicate that the counter values are actually a sum
of multiple interface counters (or maybe an integer of the number of
interfaces the counters are summed up)? Otherwise, an NMS could not
differentiate whether a counter is from a single interface or the sum
of multiple. This could become relevant if, e.g., failure counters
trigger some kind of alarm when being higher than a certain threshold.
Using the sum of multiple would surpass that threshold much quicker
evidently.

Best regards
Ulrich

Hi,

since these are different objects, I think the semantics of the
counters are always clear. The rest is an implementation detail
(whether you keep separate counters or not).

Hello Peter,

Thanks for this new revision.
As is, the document looks fine to me.
We at Orange look forward to seeing this implemented in DECT products so th=
at we can deploy a unified, IPv6-based, home automation solution on multipl=
e link technologies.
Best regards,

Hello Fernando,

ed by Erik), or,
> b) Do not mention this RFC at all.

for me no preference. I would expect you can either list all known RFCs wit=
h such issues, or don't mention any such RFC. In case a) both RFC6282 and 6=
775 should be included.

regards,
Esko

Hi, Esko,

Thanks so much for your feedback! Please find my responses in-line....

Since this one does not really follow the "SHOULD NOT", I guess we might op=
t to:

a) List the RFC as "There are issues with this specification" (as suggested=
 by Erik), or,

b) Do not mention this RFC at all.


Thoughts?

I'd suggest that draft-ietf-6man-default-iids is referenced in that I-D.
Then you either follow the advice in draft-ietf-6man-default-iids, or expla=
in your reasoning to go against it. (this was suggested by Dave Thaler earl=
ier on).

I'll check the aforementioned I-D when I land (I'm currently on a plane). I=
'd note that the issue is not only about IIDs being derived from hardware a=
ddresses, but also about they being constant across different network attac=
hment points.

Agree with Fernando.  Anything that is an RFC and "just works" with
stable-privacy should be listed with Updates.

My slight preference is to not mention it in default-iids itself.
However, I'm also ok with saying the 6lo issue is left for future work.
In my opinion, though, default-iids should NOT list anything as=20
"a valid reason to go against the SHOULD/SHOULD NOT".

Hello,

the WGLC of draft-ietf-6lo-lowpan-mib has ended on April 28. On April
30, I asked for additional comments and indication of whether or not
to request publication for this draft. Given the lack of responses, it
is not possible for the chairs to determine consensus, and we can
therefore (currently) not proceed with publication, unless there is
further support from the WG to publish the draft.

One option is to discuss an information model first, before continuing
the work on a data model. We may also want to talk about the general
requirements for management of constrained nodes; I can only speculate
that maybe some participants feel that the current MIB module does not
fit their needs (e.g., in terms of constrainedness of the nodes). I am
interested in determining *how* we want/expect these low-powered
devices to be monitored/managed if WG participants feel that the
currently suggested approach is not the right one.

I realize that some of these discussions have been led in the COMAN
activity, so there could be some duplication. We will definitely have
time to discuss this issue in Toronto, but I encourage to have an open
discussion on the mailing list first.

Best regards
Ulrich

Hi,

Taking into account the effort already invested in creating a data model, w=
ould it be appropriate to consider that instead of 'discussing the informat=
ion model' we could publish the current document as a 'reference informatio=
n model'? Before you ask - I am well aware about the differences between da=
ta models and information models as described in RFC 3444. I have seen howe=
ver MIB modules published (some as Proposed Standard RFCs) but not implemen=
ted for SNMP agents - however the modeling effort was used in part or as a =
whole for other protocols or management access interfaces. It seems to me t=
hat the I-D could be published as an Informational RFC with a note reflecti=
ng the history of the effort and stating that although the MIB module could=
 not get consensus to be used as a data model, the modeling work can be use=
d as a reference information model.=20

Regards,

Dan

I support publication of this document. Given the difficulty most WG have in
getting anyone to produce a data model, the fact that we've had ANY
discussion about it is support.

I don't think I've read the last version, but I know that I've reviewed
previous versions.

I apologize for not paying much attention =97 I had thought that this =
document would be a safe bet for going forward.
Like Michael, I haven=92t done a recent review of the spec, but I =
certainly agree with its principles.
We need a set of indicators on our constrained devices, and this set =
seemed good enough for determining the health of 6LoWPAN without =
overtaxing the devices.

Hi Dan,

that's a good suggestion if there is no consensus to go standards
track. Thanks for pointing this out.

Best regards

 Hi all,

I have  a draft on securing RFC 6775 using a form of SeND, the draft is at:

http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-sarikaya-ace-cga-nd-00.txt

Ulrich and Samita told me that such issues are in scope with 6lo.


I'll appreciate your comments on this draft.

Regards,

Behcet

Can you please comment on the status of your implementation? What about DEC=

Thanks

Hello Peter,

Thanks for this new revision.
As is, the document looks fine to me.
We at Orange look forward to seeing this implemented in DECT products so th=
at we can deploy a unified, IPv6-based, home automation solution on multipl=
e link technologies.
Best regards,

Dominique

Bits-N-Bites at IETF 90 in Toronto will focus on the Internet of Things, =
and the IETF invites you and your organization to participate!

The arrival of Things connected to the Internet in recent years has =
given life to new applications in both the consumer and industrial =
market segments. We are surrounded by products that utilize connectivity =
and a growing enthusiasm suggests imminent and impressive deployments: =
billions of new connected devices are expected by year 2020.  In the =
industrial world, wide spread wireless sensoring devices that collect =
data and measurements will move us into the next phase of process =
optimization. This will require the combination of the best of =
Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), forming the =
IT/OT convergence.

When deploying multi-stage Thing topologies, two trends compete: IP =
protocols are enhanced and transformed into less end-to-end protocols =
(address translation, header compression, 'mesh under' routing and more) =
and, alternatively, existing IP protocols are reduced to their bare =
minimum such as to fit in reduced Things (reduced CPU frequency and =
number of transistors, dimensions and energy consumption).

IETF 90 demonstrations should exhibit recent developments of IP =
protocols for IoT networks (6lowpan adaptation layers, MANET and RPL =
routing protocols, 6tsch time-constrained communications, CoAP app-layer =
protocols) as well as demonstrations of the tendency of bringing the =
known IPv6 as close as possible to the Thing - minimum set of unmodified =
IPv6, Neighbor Discovery, DHCP, HTTP, IKEv2. Demonstrations of =
geo-location uses in and for IP networking and the surrounding privacy =
issues are also welcome.

Does your organization want to reach 1,200 Internet engineers and =
demonstrate your IoT technologies and usage of IETF protocols? This is =
your opportunity to show leading industry professionals the latest and =
greatest of what you do in a social and interactive setting.

Examples of demos include, but are not limited, to:

=95 home automation controller using SNMP for HVAC and ambient =
temperature, electricity counter;
=95 industrial-grade Wireless Sensor Network products;
=95 scalable wireless designs and existing deployments;
=95 IPv6 end-to-end and backbone interconnection;
=95 tablet summarizing status of widespread devices through =
heterogeneous link connections;
=95 smart belt collecting body information with low-energy communication =
protocols;
=95 vehicle interior connected designs, vehicle-to-road sensor-based =
communications;
=95 sensor-assisted autonomous mobile Things (mono-, bi-, quad- wheeled =
or propelled devices);
=95 vehicular communications (e.g. dead-reckoning enhancements for =
enhanced GPS localization, geo-dissemination);
=95 smartphone applications relying on geo-localization.

There many ways to configure your demo, such as:=20

=95 Things deployed on a table, relying on local connections and =
alternatively exhibiting remote access across the Internet;
=95 a poster describing a demo;
=95 video sequence showing a lab demonstration.

Hello Peter,

Thanks for this revision, good work!

We at Gigaset already deploy 6lo-v6over-dect-ule based IoT solutions called=
 Gigaset Elements.
The advantage of the described solution is the simplicity to interconnect w=
ith Cloud/APP based services.

With best regards,

Dear WG,

thanks for getting back to me regarding publication of the 6lowpan-MIB
draft. So far we have 3 people supporting publication, nobody
objecting it. Any further +1/-1 for publication is appreciated.

I have the following further questions, that I ask you to respond to
within two weeks (until
June 5).

1. How many of you plan to implement this draft or have implemented it?
2. How many of you plan to use it for a real deployment?
3. Should this document be informational, experimental or standards track?

I want to know what the intended status of this document should be,
and have to answer these questions later in the write-up.

Best regards
Ulrich

I have no plans to talk to this Information Model with SNMP.
I know that there is some code from the authors, and I would anticipate using
it in the interim on devices I have deployed.

I would really prefer (for code space and reuse reasons) to talk to it via
YANG over CoAP, and I believe (perhaps naively) that going from MIB
to YANG model is a well understood mechanical process, and that the
work to do that over CoAP is also well underway.

For the sake of completeness, we did (except the per interface
statistics, which several people requested to be added but later did
not have time to review the changes).

Out code is open source code - who knows what people do with it and
what is real deployment.

Reading RFC 2026 again (and noting that RFC 6410 does not change the
definition of Proposed Standard in RFC 2026), I think it should be
standards track.

For me, the key question is whether we can be reasonably sure we got
the counters right. If so, make it standards-track, otherwise make it
experimental. Informational seems somewhat strange (most IETF MIBs are
actuall Proposed Standard, actually the "good enough" state as some
say. The relatively few Informational MIB modules the IETF has were
either developed outside WGs or they ended up being Informational
because of IPR concerns.

The people I work for, have an interest in management, but do not know 
yet what are the important aspects to track during operation.
They are worried about message size, and prefer coap over snmp.
They do not care about YANG or SMI modelling, but SMI seems to include 
all wanted functionality.

Hello,

Samita and I have discussed about the lowpan MIB draft. I appreciate
that several of you have expressed your support for the document on
the 6lo list, so we both believe that there is sufficient consensus
now to go forward.

However, we personally don't feel that Standards Track is the right
status. Several people on the list mentioned that they are not yet
sure how they will manage 6lowpans, possibly with more lightweight
protocols. (We understand that a MIB module is not necessarily tied to
SNMP, and that it can be converted to YANG if desired.) But most
importantly, there seems to be a lack of (interoperable)
implementations. So far, only J=C3=BCrgen mentioned he has an
implementation. There was also no intention on the list to deploy or
implement the MIB module in the near future. We believe that this
draft is a good candidate for Experimental, as it allows people to
first figure out how they want to manage their networks, whether the
proposed approach is suitable, whether the counters are the right
ones, and to get implementation experience.

This should be a consensual decision by the WG, so we ask you to send
any objections or support for this suggestion to the list.


Best regards
Ulrich

Hi Peter,

Thanks for the detail document . I have briefly read it.

A couple of high-level comment:

Section 2.4 :   Needs a bit clarification  on variable MTU size specificati=
on on DECT-le.  For most situations it seems it will not need fragmentation=
 reassembly in the L2.


Section 3.2:  Says "The DECT ULE implements FAR functionality and [RFC4944<=
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4944>]
   MUST NOT be used" . This sentence can be clarified by saying that RFC494=
4 fragmentation/re-assembly function is not needed [?].


Thanks,
-Samita

Hello 6lo WG:

draft-mariager-6lo-v6over-dect-ule has been around and presented at the 6lo=
 WG before. The recent version (03)  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-maria=
ger-6lo-v6over-dect-ule-03   has detail information about running IPv6 over=
 DECT-ULE network.

There are at least two comments in the list on the deployment of such imple=
mentation.  The document is well in the scope of 6lo charter.

The WG-chairs would like to propose to adopt this document as a WG draft gi=
ven the interest in this document in the WG.
The adoption call ends at June 11, 2014.

If there is no objection on adopting this as a WG document,  the draft-mari=
ager-6lo-v6over-dect-ule-03  should be submitted as a 00 WG document  after=
 the adoption call.

Thank you.

-Samita

Hello Samita, all,

I'm in favour of adopting this document as a WG document.
Bringing this to an RFC will enable acceptance and deployment of IPv6 solut=
ions over a technology that is well adopted for Home Automation, Assisted L=
iving and e-Health.
Best regards

Dominique

Objet : [6lo] WG Adoption for draft-mariager-6lo-v6over-dect-ule-03

Hello 6lo WG:

draft-mariager-6lo-v6over-dect-ule has been around and presented at the 6lo=
 WG before. The recent version (03)  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-maria=
ger-6lo-v6over-dect-ule-03   has detail information about running IPv6 over=
 DECT-ULE network.

There are at least two comments in the list on the deployment of such imple=
mentation.  The document is well in the scope of 6lo charter.

The WG-chairs would like to propose to adopt this document as a WG draft gi=
ven the interest in this document in the WG.
The adoption call ends at June 11, 2014.

If there is no objection on adopting this as a WG document,  the draft-mari=
ager-6lo-v6over-dect-ule-03  should be submitted as a 00 WG document  after=
 the adoption call.

Thank you.

-Samita
